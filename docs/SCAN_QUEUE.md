# Scan Queue Contract

`frigo-scan-queue` uses at-least-once delivery. The Worker consumer accepts
only versioned, tenant-scoped messages:

```json
{
  "type": "scan.process.v1",
  "jobId": "scan_job_scan_123",
  "scanId": "scan_123",
  "userId": "user_123",
  "householdId": "household_123",
  "imageKey": "users/user_123/scans/scan_123/original.webp",
  "scanType": "fridge",
  "idempotencyKey": "scan_123:v1"
}
```

The consumer persists `scan_queue_jobs` and transitions both the job and scan
through `pending -> processing -> ready` or `failed`. A duplicate delivery is
acknowledged without invoking AI again. A processing lease older than ten
minutes may be reclaimed after a crashed isolate. Retryable AI/R2 failures are
requeued for up to `max_attempts` (default 3); invalid messages, missing scans,
missing images, and tenant conflicts are permanent failures and are acked after
being logged (jobs with a valid scan are also recorded as `failed`). The
production consumer is configured with the Cloudflare dead-letter queue
`frigo-scan-dlq` for retained poison-message payloads after retry exhaustion.

AI provider failures use a typed classification rather than retrying every
exception. `MODEL_NOT_FOUND`, `AUTHENTICATION_FAILED`, `PERMISSION_DENIED`,
`LICENSE_REQUIRED`, `SCHEMA_VALIDATION`, `INVALID_RESPONSE` and
`AI_SCAN_NO_USABLE_ITEMS` are permanent for the current job. `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`,
`NETWORK_ERROR`, `RATE_LIMITED` and `UPSTREAM_ERROR` are retryable until the
normal attempt limit. `scan_queue_jobs.error_code` stores the bounded
classification; the public scan status exposes only an actionable code/message
and attempt counters, never provider credentials or raw image data.
OCR output is still an untrusted review draft and must not bypass confirmation.

Quota (ADR-039, `docs/ai/scan/SCAN_QUOTA_SEMANTICS.md`): the producer only
reserves. The consumer consumes the reservation in the fenced batch that
commits `ready` and releases it in the fenced batch that commits a terminal
`failed` (including a lease that expired on its final attempt). A retryable
attempt keeps the reservation. Producer and consumer log PII-free
`scan_enqueued` / `scan_enqueue_failed` / `scan_rejected` / `scan_job_ready` /
`scan_job_retry` / `scan_job_failed` events keyed by `scanRef`, which
`ai_usage` lines and the public scan status (`supportRef`) also carry.

Before sending jobs, apply the complete migration ledger through the candidate's
current migration (including `0012_scan_queue_jobs.sql` and, for the OCR
recovery candidate, `0023_scan_request_fingerprint.sql`) to the target D1
database and verify with `pnpm check:migrations`/the remote schema gate. Deploy
the Worker only after the schema gate confirms the new columns are present.

## Canary rollout

`SCAN_QUEUE_MODE=async` is the production setting after provider smoke
validation. Use `SCAN_QUEUE_MODE=sync` as the rollback switch if queue health
degrades, then send a small test cohort after recovery,
and watch queue metrics plus `scan_queue_jobs` status transitions. Roll back to
`sync` if retry rate, consumer lag, or failed jobs increase; pending scans can
then be reprocessed by the synchronous endpoint without changing the D1 schema.

For the Qwen runtime candidate, verify the role aliases and DashScope access with
a non-PII provider smoke before deployment. Production sets
`AI_QWEN_ONLY=true`, so Groq, Cloudflare, DeepSeek and GLM are not constructed;
their adapters remain compatibility-only when Qwen-only mode is disabled.
Reasoning/judge roles are off by default. A model/license/configuration failure
is not repaired by replaying the same message; fix configuration or upload a
new scan.
The recovery adds migration `0023_scan_request_fingerprint.sql` and must remain
marked unreleased until exact-SHA CI, guarded migration, readiness and canary
evidence are recorded.
