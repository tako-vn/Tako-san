# T21R-C4I remediation handoff - 2026-10-03 JST

Draft PR #38 on `codex/t21rc4-cloudflare-identity-diagnostic` remains the sole
integration vehicle. The independent review of head
`a5966c7fa27b67d16ff02acb753cd2bc82c372fa` required 2 P1 and 2 P2 fixes.
This additive remediation introduces a separate reviewed-byte/exact-main-CI gate,
validates the exact normal production approval and policy before credential use,
matches C2's account-ID syntax, and splits command failures from malformed D1
responses. The C2 73-path closure and historical production failure are intact.

Local checks: focused C4I+C2 8 files / 340 PASS; full UTC Vitest 234 files /
5,303 PASS; lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build and diff PASS. The final
source of truth is the new remediation commit and its fresh hosted PR CI, not the
old CI run 37114032245. At handoff, production diagnostic/C2 rerun/Environment
approval/SQL/secret changes/0039/deploy have not occurred. Token scope remains
UNKNOWN. Next: confirm new exact-head PR CI, then request independent delta
review; keep PR draft, do not merge or dispatch production.

# T21R-C4I metadata identity diagnostic handoff — 2026-10-03 JST

**State:** `T21RC4I_IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW`, not live certification.
Repository `vn-tak/Tako-san` / 1385308553; branch
`codex/t21rc4-cloudflare-identity-diagnostic`, base
`7cd58968c3b4c0f7936c75d74b6965d229b57c69`. C3 protected integration is certified;
C2 reviewed head `93c4055a42cd2d94f4db296d8ca10d555c2c52c2` remains eligible subject
to future-main byte equivalence/ancestry/CI and unchanged gates. Verified published
code checkpoint `81646b0e6389fe61ea04db5892dec8ee597693f9` matches local tested
`dfad66da7706bf315e4b0e27b0e471b9ce71cb83` tree `00c68d1b21f9dd965a1936632ee479b1320d16f2`.
API author/date metadata changes SHA; local source history is preserved. Final
completion-doc head is verified/reported externally to avoid a document self-hash.

**Implementation:** Four new diagnostic workflow/script/test files, dedicated
report and minimal status/ADR notes. Manual/main-only/attempt-1, production
Environment, shared `frigo-deploy-production` lock, no cancellation, contents-read
only, immutable certified Actions, exact workflow SHA checkout, frozen tooling.
Credentials only in final script-step env. Fixed whoami/list calls; A–H stage
receipts, strict config and early aborts, private captured output, 0700 null-sink
Wrangler log setup/cleanup, no raw artifact. Formatter allowlists every field and
keeps read-only proof false. Stage B lowercase syntax is intentionally stricter
than unchanged C2; a new observation is not retrospective credential proof.

**Executed:** Focused pnpm10 6 files / 308 PASS (35 diagnostic, 26 static/workflow,
148 approval, 70 capture, 8 receipt, 21 C2 workflow). Compatibility fixtures
compare eight configs to the existing verifier. Real local Git reviewed-SHA /
additive-diagnostic regression passes; bound-byte mutation rejects. Lint,
typecheck, real local SQLite 3.45.1 migration smoke, web/Worker build and Node
syntax/diff PASS. Final `pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=1` with default/JSON
reporters: UTC 232 files / 5,271 PASS, zero skips, exit 0, 494.41 seconds.
External Node transport blocked; one attempt per full run denied before network
use, two separate positive guard probes also denied. Proxy variables cleared;
all new Wrangler test calls mocked. No unrestricted or hosted C4I result claimed.

**Failures / resolution:** pnpm11 auto-install refused an outside-root worktree
modules link before tests; preserve modules/use isolated pnpm10.34.6 without
package/lockfile change. First direct focused run: 282 tests PASS, one workflow
suite parse failure from dot access to a hyphenated property; correct brackets
and syntax checks, then 308/308 PASS. First completed full run inherited PDT:
5,269 PASS / 2 FAIL (weekday/expired-OTP). Preserve that receipt; unchanged two
suites pass 32/32 under test-process UTC, then fresh full UTC PASS. No application,
Week/auth, assertion, timeout, selection, dependency or security guard changed.

**Live evidence / limits:** Task error T21RC2_IDENTITY_REJECTED in run 37084988593
attempt 1, actor tako-vn1, exact certified main. GitHub jobs confirm gate/approval
validator SUCCESS, capture FAIL, subsequent publication steps skipped, cleanup
SUCCESS. Source identity proof precedes any fixed SQL: historical D1 SQL 0/0,
mutations 0; metadata calls POSSIBLE / NOT FULLY DISTINGUISHABLE. No raw log read.
Current diagnostic NOT_RUN; no C2 rerun, Cloudflare call, production SQL/mutation,
Environment approval/policy edit or secret/token mutation by this implementation.
Token scope UNKNOWN, read-only-unproven; production identity cause still unknown.

**Next:** Independent review of final published C4I head before PR. Any later
protected integration and metadata-only execution need separate authority and
normal independent Environment approval. Never bypass, self-approve, change
secrets/tokens, run SQL or rerun C2 based on diagnostic completion. Future C2 ref
must be actual post-diagnostic current main with existing exact-main/binding gates.
T21G_NOT_READY, repair NOT_AUTHORIZED, 0039/deploy STOPPED, delivery UNCONFIGURED.

# T21R-C3 dispatch readiness handoff — 2026-10-03 JST

**State:** `T21RC3_IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW`;
code, local checks and approved documentation publication complete, not production
ready. Owner login/write access works.
Repository `1385308553` / `vn-tak/Tako-san`; branch
`codex/t21rc3-production-dispatch-readiness`, exact starting main
`0d4fe89b7ccc72e013aafe53665059d0e62bd3b4`. Historical PR36/C2 protection and
exact-main push CI `37008867187` are verified. Tested code checkpoints
`57edc3ac9c2b3f86d28774c0c26bb1e9a961746e` and
`a34ec5e3245b5fdc6718c611ae23dcea6f56eb4c`; final documentation follows, so its
own/future publication SHA is not embedded here. The recovery receipt records the
historical local-only head. GitData publication code checkpoint
`e49c60a176cec80593e8b8644d058341cfeca720` has the certified base as parent and
exact tested executable tree `5b20d72eeb4f0077ac17b0d0e8584e4596292fb3`.
API commit metadata changes its SHA; original local checkpoint history is kept.
Final docs-inclusive remote head must be fetched/verified and reported externally.

**Implemented:** Official upstream commit pins for checkout/setup-node/pnpm/
upload-artifact, six external uses, no mutable refs. Production workflow only
changes Action identity; CI remains unchanged/full history. Gate and receipt's
current repository guards use the transferred name; the certified target's
review-time name/bytes remain intact. Static mutation tests and real-Git pin
binding tests preserve all 73 closure entries. Documentation supplies the future
operator packet and metadata governance/token-scope results; no dispatch helper.
One AI test's accidental call-through fetch is replaced by a synthetic 401,
with existing assertions intact, to make required full validation fixture-only.

**Executed:** Focused C3/C2/C/B/release command 8 files / 556 PASS; C2 suite counts
148 approval, 70 capture, 8 receipt, 21 workflow. Guarded provider/governance/scan
and local D1 6 files / 128 PASS. Final full `vitest run --maxWorkers=1` with
default/JSON reporting: 230 files / 5,210 PASS, zero skips, exit 0. Lint/typecheck/
local SQLite migration smoke/build/syntax/diff PASS. pnpm 10.34.6 and extracted
real SQLite 3.45.1 CLI; package/lockfile unchanged. Test proxy variables cleared,
temporary Node loopback-only preload outside repo; one remote transport attempt denied
before network use. Earlier partial full runs are not passing receipts. Exact
commands, installer/proxy/name-guard failures and automatic egress-review
rejection/resolution are in the scoped report.
The exact published code checkpoint was rechecked with the existing local Vitest:
C2 4 files / 247 PASS, 11.39 seconds, under the same loopback-only/proxy-cleared
environment. The first attempt failed only because the prior scratch pnpm.cjs
entrypoint no longer existed; no installation or dependency change was needed.

**Governance / limits:** Public GitHub Environment GET at 2026-10-02T18:22:04Z:
production `22649920074`, exact User reviewer `vn-taphoanhatung` / `329713999`,
self-review prevention false, admin bypass available true, branch policy null.
No policy change; availability is not use. Existing normal-approval validator
still rejects self/skipped/bypass/wrong reviewer or Environment and reruns.
Metadata-only audit PASS; live approval unverified/NOT_RUN. SELECT-only path true;
Cloudflare read-only token scope unproven/UNKNOWN. No token metadata call/mutation.
Application/T19/T20/config/canonical/migrations/CI and 73-path list unchanged.

**Publication access:** Earlier normal Git push failed because no CLI credential was
available. First workflow-blob write through the `takovn2` connection returned
403 `Resource not accessible by integration`; no remote blob/tree/commit/ref or
PR was created. Installation metadata for `takovn2` and `tako-vn` lists only
those respective owners, not `vn-tak`. No write via the second connection or
reviewer account, permission mutation or bypass was attempted. The generic error
did not prove a particular missing scope. The current `vn-tak` connection now
verifies profile/owner `335007142`, installation `167341024` and actual workflow
blob writes. Use normal GitData publication with this selected connection;
preserve original local history, check trees, fetch and compare exact final heads.
No login, permission mutation or reviewer-account write is needed. The earlier
recovery ZIP remains historical and is superseded for current status.
C3 hosted CI has not run.

**Publication:** Earlier automatic approval review rejected the full historical
CURRENT_STATE payload, its evidence-based retry, and the compact C3 report for
public operational metadata without explicit payload/destination consent. The
user confirmed all five documents from the preserved approval packet for public
`vn-tak/Tako-san` on 2026-10-03 JST, including completion status updates.
Their documentation checkpoint follows `e49c60a176cec80593e8b8644d058341cfeca720`
through a normal feature-ref update. All tested executable bytes and original
local history are preserved. Final documentation-inclusive local/remote SHA and
tree equality are in the external completion receipt, avoiding a self-hash.
No login, permission expansion or production operation was required.

**Boundary / next:** Obtain independent review of the final published C3 head
**before opening a PR**.
Old reviewed head `63739c56` is invalid for a post-C3 main: future `reviewed_sha`
is the independently approved final C3 head; future `ref` is exact post-merge
current main with successful push CI and byte-identical closure. Complete safe
metadata placeholders and the operator's unresolved token-scope risk decision.
Require fresh normal independent production approval only for a separately
authorized new attempt-1 capture. No PR/merge/dispatch/approval/D1 read/write/
Cloudflare SQL/restore/0039 apply/deploy in C3. LIVE capture NOT_RUN, T21G_NOT_READY,

# T21R-C2 PR #36 CI-history remediation handoff — 2026-10-02 UTC

**State:** Narrow local Git-history environment correction; not new independent
approval, merge readiness or production authorization. Same C2 branch, PR #36
OPEN/unmerged, repository `1385308553` / `vn-tako4/Tako-san`; verified reviewed
pre-fix head `3e1bb60b7afa9706fca6bfed41252bfd4d421cdd` and base main
`518818458a354c5e180da52ae9bb73c9d3c1af78`. This checkpoint cannot embed its own hash
or future hosted run ID; final exact-head results are retained in PR checks and
`.hoplite/artifacts/t21rc2-pr36-ci/`.

**Implemented:** CI checkout now `fetch-depth: 0`, plus one regression in the
existing C2 static workflow suite requiring historical Git objects. Hosted old
run `37002486858` / job `110823126447` had depth 1 and fetched only synthetic
merge `db7728d0203089e8f35897f2fff2f2e35437e026`. Offline shallow fixture reproduces
missing certified-main object -> `T21RC2_LEDGER_CHANGED`; full-history helper
still yields exact first 38 of 39 repository names through 0038. No actual ledger
drift, guard relaxation, authority substitution or unit-test network call.

**Executed:** C2 command PASS, 4 files / 229 tests; focused C2/T21R-C/B/release
command PASS, 8 files / 538. `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:migrations`,
`pnpm build` PASS. Full single-worker 230 files / 5,192 PASS, 701.72 seconds.
Exact commands and syntax/diff checks are
in `recipe-catalog/T21RC2_PROTECTED_PRODUCTION_ROW_READ.md`. Initial direct-path
shallow clone ignored depth/failed hardlink; corrected offline file-transport
clone proved diagnosis and was removed. No timeout/assertion changes.

**Production boundary / limits:** No production dispatch/Environment approval/
Cloudflare call/D1 read/mutation/restore/migration/0039 apply/deploy. Local smoke
fixtures only. No production workflow, versions, config, classifier/schema/target,
73-entry closure or ledger policy change. Old independent review of `3e1bb60b`
does not authorize new CI bytes. Delivery UNCONFIGURED / DELIVERY_NOT_AUTHORIZED;
T21G_NOT_READY, repair NOT_AUTHORIZED, 0039/deploy STOPPED.

**Next:** Normal push of one narrow commit, inspect automatically triggered PR36
CI at its exact new head, require all five hosted gates PASS; if it fails, stop
INCOMPLETE with run/job/failure. Then independent delta review from `3e1bb60b`
and renewed approval before merge. Do not close/create another PR or dispatch.
PR auto-fix subscription is enabled; this packet's no-fix-piling stop remains.

# T21R-C2 review-binding remediation handoff — 2026-10-02 UTC

**State:** `T21RC2_REMEDIATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW`, not re-approved or production-ready.
Repository `1385308553` / `vn-tako4/Tako-san`; same
`codex/t21rc2-protected-production-row-read`, reviewed parent
`8d8028f3e3358655b19fa2dd02ba883e57c52204`, verified prior implementation
`ad7b3012`, certified base main `518818458a354c5e180da52ae9bb73c9d3c1af78`.
One logical remediation commit follows that reviewed head without rebase/squash;
its own hash is resolved by final Git/provider verification, not embedded here.

**Implemented:** P1 binds the current ref's 73-entry security/execution closure
to the exact reviewed implementation bytes in addition to preserved ancestry/
main/CI/normal approval guards, rejects equal SHAs, and gates candidate output,
pre-Cloudflare capture and final publication recheck. Full dependency tracing and
optional auto-config absence/addition semantics are documented. P2 success
receipt: `queryPathSelectOnly=true`, `tokenScopeReadOnlyProven=false`; no token
introspection or override. Failure omits both because path attestation can fail
before execution. No workflow/capture/classifier/schema/target/runtime redesign.

**Executed:** `pnpm exec vitest run tests/unit/t21rc2-*.test.mjs tests/unit/t21rc-row-reconciliation.test.mjs tests/unit/t21rb-v1-semantic.test.mjs tests/unit/t21rb-v1-production.test.mjs tests/unit/release-check.test.mjs --maxWorkers=1`
PASS, 8 files / 537 tests (C2 228, T21R-C/B 73, release 236).
`pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=1` PASS, 230 files / 5,191, 608.00 seconds.
`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build`, script
syntax, diff and protected-path checks PASS. Real temporary Git A–L/binding/
addition regressions and API mocks only. Initial test-helper import/scope errors
were fixed; no timeout/assertion weakened. Bounded agent review found no material
issue in guard/P2 logic and passed 151 tests; it did not re-audit the full closure.

**Production boundary / limits:** Zero production read/Cloudflare call/dispatch/
mutation/SQL write/Environment approval/restore/migration/0039 apply/deploy; no
production secrets, PR or merge. SQLite smoke writes throwaway local fixtures
only. Approval history, fixed SELECTs, two-read stability, row privacy and no
row-manifest upload remain unchanged. Row delivery `UNCONFIGURED` /
`DELIVERY_NOT_AUTHORIZED`. No human re-approval or hosted delta-head CI is claimed.

**Next:** Normally publish exactly one logical remediation commit after the
reviewed head, verify remote/local equality, then stop for independent delta
review from `8d8028f3` to that published HEAD **before opening any PR**. No
production authorization or delivery configuration. `T21G_NOT_READY`, repair

# T21R-C2 executable protected row-read handoff — 2026-10-02 UTC

**State:** `T21RC2_IMPLEMENTATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW`, not production-ready.
Repository `1385308553` / `vn-tako4/Tako-san`; correct branch
`codex/t21rc2-protected-production-row-read`, exact base/start
`518818458a354c5e180da52ae9bb73c9d3c1af78`, exact-main CI `36972970904` SUCCESS.
Verified executable implementation `ad7b3012` (`ad7b3012fc13c53948cdf7cbac4362df2662dee5`)
normally pushed; provider HEAD equaled local implementation. Old wrong-direction
`9542e112` preserved on its old local branch, excluded from C2 and never pushed.
This handoff is a later documentation checkpoint, not its own hash claim.

**Implemented:** Dispatch-only C2 workflow and four scripts for hardened main/CI/
ancestry and normal independent approval, exact account/database/config identity,
fixed SELECT execution, complete ledger/count/roster/two-read capture, credential-free
original classifier/schema, private runner-temp files/logs and aggregate-only
success receipt. Skipped/admin-bypass/self approvals and unbound reruns fail.
Actual approval API shape is tested; current bypass availability is not bypass
use. Fresh main is queried before credential use and final aggregate publication.
Row delivery remains `UNCONFIGURED` / `DELIVERY_NOT_AUTHORIZED`; no storage built.

**Executed:** `pnpm exec vitest run tests/unit/t21rc2-*.test.mjs tests/unit/t21rc-row-reconciliation.test.mjs tests/unit/t21rb-v1-semantic.test.mjs tests/unit/t21rb-v1-production.test.mjs tests/unit/release-check.test.mjs --maxWorkers=1`
PASS, 8 files / 455 tests (C2 146, T21R-C/B 73, release 236).
`pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=1` PASS, 230 files / 5,109, 525.17 seconds.
`pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build`, C2 syntax,
working/staged diff and protected-path reviews PASS. Initial fixture/module
integration failures and synthetic 5-second setup timeout are recorded, not hidden;
fixture preparation moved to `beforeAll`, assertions/timeouts unchanged. Independent
agent review found no material defect. Exact logs/checks are in the report.

**Production boundary / limits:** No production read, Cloudflare production call,
dispatch, Environment approval, mutation, operational SQL write, restore,
migration/0039 apply, deploy or flags; no PR/merge. Local SQLite tests use
throwaway fixtures, including their existing schema replay. No T19/T20/household/
inventory/Week, original classifier/schema, dependency or existing workflow change.
No live row receipt, hosted C2-head CI or human approval; normal code publication
does not authorize production. Raw/full manifests are never Actions artifacts.
Same observed A/B permits only `OBSERVED_STABLE_NON_ATOMIC`, not atomicity.

**Next:** Independent review of the actual published C2 executable workflow,
approval, query, schema binding, privacy/failure path and receipt before any
production authorization. Do not dispatch or configure row delivery in this task.
Keep `T21G_NOT_READY`, repair NOT_AUTHORIZED, 0039/deploy STOPPED.

# T21R-C P1-only remediation handoff — 2026-10-02 UTC

**State:** `T21RC_REMEDIATION_READY_FOR_REVIEW`; mandatory local validation PASS.
Branch `codex/t21rc-row-level-reconciliation`, repository `1385308553` /
`vn-tako4/Tako-san`, reviewed head `32ab51d35976e5174f73a544729f8bd7fd20e02c`
(implementation ancestor `ec24101`). One remediation checkpoint follows that
head without rebase/merge/squash. Its own hash is not embedded in its handoff;
verify the exact local/remote HEAD with Git. Existing `.context/` is preserved.

**Implemented:** Explicit exact-tuple balance plus membership before satisfaction;
direct V1 identity precedes bridge lookup, without general registry precedence
or relaxed bridge predicates. Six new A1–A3/B1–B3 regressions; old tests intact.
Pre-edit A cases already met fail-closed expectations; B1/B3 reproduced the
wrong production-only/missing classes. No other implementation semantics changed.

**Executed:** T21R-C 57/57 and regression set 73/73 PASS; lint/typecheck/local
in-memory migration smoke/build/syntax/formatting/diff PASS. Full
`pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=1` PASS: 226 files / 4,963 tests,
678.21 seconds. No timeout/assertion edited, failures encountered in required
checks, two-worker retry, dependency re-audit or upgrade.

**Production boundary / limits:** No production read/write, workflow dispatch,
approval, restore, migration/0039 apply, deploy or repair. Schema/taxonomy/V1/V2/
runtime/privacy unchanged. No live row receipt or independent approval exists.

**Next:** Independently review the single normally published remediation delta
from `32ab51d` to the exact verified local/remote HEAD. Normal push is authorized
after these passing checks; no self-approval, PR, merge or production dispatch
preparation; `T21G_NOT_READY`, repair/0039/deploy STOPPED.

# T21R-C protected row-level evidence handoff — 2026-10-02 UTC

**State:** `T21RC_OFFLINE_DESIGN_READY`. Offline implementation/design completed on
`codex/t21rc-row-level-reconciliation`; base/source main `a828b6354e29d89268a3d11c874158eb5ecb997c`,
repository `1385308553` / `vn-tako4/Tako-san`. Verified implementation
`ec24101` (`ec24101bd906b820d3a6ac29dcc179dd62a1d3fa`); this is a later documentation checkpoint,
not a self-referential commit claim. Existing `.context/` remains untracked
and untouched; no forensic workspace was reset.

**Implemented:** Pure deterministic occurrence classifier, closed schema,
shared byte-pinned V1 source loader (existing T21R-B CLI compatible), multiset
accounting, per-recipe/drift/conflict/review evidence and protected-read/privacy
design. Names/quantities/physical IDs stay local; no action class or repair SQL.
Mixed multiplicity, incomplete capture and alternate-ID false absence corrected.
V1 `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4` / 500 / 2,702 remains target; current approved bridges=0.

**Executed:** Focused 3 files / 67 tests PASS (51 new + 16 existing), actual
offline CLIs on synthetic certified-source 500/2,702 PASS, source proof/Ajv/
syntax/formatting/lint/typecheck/local migration smoke/build/diff PASS.
Two-worker full suite: 1 failed / 4,956 passed, 226 files; the unchanged existing
certification query test hit 5 seconds. Final unchanged
`pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=1` PASS: 226 files / 4,957 tests in
837.08 seconds, including both formerly timing-out CLI-heavy cases.
Earlier 600-second attempt stopped with intermediate fixture/CLI timeouts;
another was interrupted for the final review fix. No test timeout or assertion
was relaxed. Dependency audit separately found 33 existing advisories (4 low,
17 moderate, 12 high, 0 critical); lockfile unchanged.

**Production boundary:** Historical source run `36943692146/1` is live diagnostic
evidence, not a new dispatch here. Approval GET corroborates `skipped` by admin
`vn-tako4`, not reviewer `vn-taphoanhatung`; data accepted with a governance
exception. No live T21R-C row manifest exists. New production reads/mutations,
operational SQL writes, restores, migrations/0039 applies, deploys and flags: 0.
Required local SQLite tests use throwaway fixtures only. No workflow/application/
PayOS/authentication/inventory/Week/T19/T20 code changed. No push, PR or merge.

**Limits:** No actual per-row 1,793 drift/20 conflict breakdown, no atomic
snapshot, physical position authority or stored-reference/nutrition certification.
Public Actions artifacts are not private; row delivery needs explicit privacy
approval. Fixed-query code is not proof of a read-only underlying token scope.

**Next:** Independent human review of classifier, schema, query fields, workflow permissions,
artifact audience and stability. A separately approved normal-reviewer read
packet is required for any future dispatch. Never use admin bypass for T21G,
migration or deployment. Keep `T21G_NOT_READY`, repair/0039/deploy STOPPED.

# Production V2 existing_canonical_id review fail-closed handoff — 2026-09-30

Final P1 on PR #30: `existing_canonical_id` fails closed if `review` is present. Reviewed-new contract, recipe-id gate, and forensic flags unchanged. No production diagnostic, merge, 0039, restore, or deploy. Next: hosted CI on the new head, then independent approval.

Protected run `36653466481` confirmed production D1 `frigo-db` ledger 38/0038, 6720 ingredient rows, zero positions, 0/500 hydrated, and complete V1 line-ID mismatch. This documentation checkpoint follows the additive V2 diagnostic implementation. No production mutation, migration, restore or deploy. `FINAL_RELEASE_SHA=UNSET`.

Next: review/merge this PR, require new exact-main CI, then dispatch `Production D1 Read-Only Diagnostics` with production Environment approval. Use `production-catalog-v2-lineage-<run>-<attempt>` only as forensic evidence. Do not grant position writes from tooling alone. See `recipe-catalog/PRODUCTION_CATALOG_V2_LINEAGE_DIAGNOSTIC.md`.

# Production catalog lineage diagnostic handoff — 2026-09-30

Starting main `d0c670289534c33187181b2eb7192c05a2962e22` passed CI `36576510231`. Verified implementation commit `cd25370` adds the diagnostic; this documentation checkpoint follows it. The last protected production receipt `36577380500` reports 6,720 ingredient rows, zero order rows and 0/500 hydrated; it is not release certification. Local immutable 0038 replay gives 2,702 ingredient lines and 2,702 positions. This branch adds a runner-local V1 line comparison to the existing read-only production diagnostic, with sanitized aggregate/digest artifact and no additional remote query or secret exposure. `researchV2LineageProven=false`, `positionAuthority=NONE_GRANTED_BY_THIS_DIAGNOSTIC`, `FINAL_RELEASE_SHA=UNSET`. See `recipe-catalog/PRODUCTION_CATALOG_LINEAGE_DIAGNOSTIC.md`.

Prior PR #28 head `fe1d2e5` passed focused 14/14, controlled full Vitest 221 files / 4,823 tests, local `WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=false pnpm check` and hosted CI `36630071407`. Two earlier default-concurrency `pnpm check` attempts failed only the staging Wrangler test's five-second startup timeout; a separate long-running full Vitest attempt under machine interruption had 179/221 files pass, 67 test failures and 13 worker errors. None is represented as green. After PR #27 merged as main `e7c74a0`, PR #28 became conflicting. This branch incorporates that main and preserves the complete STOP packet. Independent code/diff review found the CLI's missing `writeFileSync` import; an actual CLI test failed before the import fix and focused tests now pass 15/15. Updated `WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=false pnpm check` passes typecheck, lint, full Vitest, migration smoke and build; `git diff --check` passes. Hosted CI must run on the new head. PR #28 remains open; GitHub review is pending. No production mutation, remote migration, restore, deployment, recipe authority change or T20 enablement occurred. Next: push the corrected PR #28, obtain new CI and GitHub review, then protected merge/new exact-main CI and a separate production Environment approval to run it. Do not infer live V2 lineage or construct positions from the count gap.

# Production ingredient-order diagnostic handoff — 2026-09-29

Main `d0c670289534c33187181b2eb7192c05a2962e22` (PR #26) passed exact-main CI `36576510231`. Production Environment-approved read-only run `36577380500` passed all workflow steps and emitted sanitized artifact `production-d1-diagnostics-36577380500-1` with diagnostic status `BLOCKED`: `frigo-db` / `f975ec39-b2c8-4a2a-80e1-0366054599d3`, ledger 38 through 0038, 500 recipes, 6,720 ingredient lines, zero order rows, 500 missing-order recipes and 0 hydrated. Earlier hydration success does not establish the deletion cause or live-line identity. No production write, migration, restore, deploy or T20 flag change occurred. `FINAL_RELEASE_SHA=UNSET`.

The read-only STOP and recovery evidence requirements are in `recipe-catalog/PRODUCTION_INGREDIENT_ORDER_RECOVERY_PACKET.md`. On the documentation-only follow-up branch, `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=false pnpm check` (typecheck, ESLint, Vitest, migration smoke, build), and `git diff --check` passed locally. Next: review a separate read-only per-line identity/position-provenance gate; only after exact source matching design a separately authorized, bookmarked recovery and recertify authority. Do not apply 0039 to try to fix catalog order.

# Order-coverage implementation checkpoint — 2026-09-29

Verified implementation commit: `c318b12` on `codex/production-d1-diagnostic-followup`, based on merged main `baf9a069f89f9544407c827448671ecea4c56b5a`. Final focused diagnostic/certification/read-only-query suite: 3 files / 72 tests PASS after workflow label cleanup. Documentation checkpoint follows this implementation commit; it does not certify or change production. Next: push PR, hosted CI, independent review, protected merge, new exact-main CI, then a separate Environment-approved read-only diagnosis.

---

# Production D1 order-coverage validation — 2026-09-29

`WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=false pnpm check` PASS on the local follow-up branch: typecheck, ESLint, 220 files / 4,816 tests, migration smoke and build. The first unfiltered full run failed one unrelated staging Wrangler test on its 5-second timeout; a focused metrics-disabled rerun passed, then the complete full run passed. `git diff --check` passed. Implementation remains local pending PR/hosted review. Next: protected merge and exact-main CI, then a new production Environment-approved read-only diagnostic. No production mutation or deploy; release remains blocked.

# Production D1 order-coverage handoff — 2026-09-29

Merged PR #25 is main `baf9a069f89f9544407c827448671ecea4c56b5a`; exact-main CI `36571635467` passed. GitHub reports `reviews=[]`. Run `36572487026` passed the protected production Environment approval and read-only identity check. Its sanitized receipt found D1 ledger 38 through 0038 (0039 missing), 500 physical recipes and 500 `missing_ingredient_position` hydration failures, leaving zero hydrated. This differs from 2026-09-25 run `36150184637`, which reported 500 hydrated/zero failures. The receipt is not release certification; production still has `CATALOG_DIAGNOSTICS` fallback. No production migration, deployment, flag change or rollback occurred.

Local branch `codex/production-d1-diagnostic-followup` adds one count-only aggregate query to distinguish missing order rows from failed joins, records only sanitized counts and checks count consistency. Focused `pnpm exec vitest run tests/unit/production-d1-diagnostics.test.mjs tests/unit/production-certify-workflow.test.mjs tests/unit/d1-readonly-query.test.mjs` passed 71 tests in 3 files. Full gates and hosted CI remain to run. Next: finish checks, independent review/PR merge and exact-main CI, then dispatch another Environment-approved read-only diagnostic. Use its counts to design a separate catalog recovery packet. Migration 0039 and production rollout remain stopped; `FINAL_RELEASE_SHA=UNSET`.

---

# Production D1 identity gate verification — 2026-09-29

PR #25's account-identity repair passed focused 6/6 and final local `pnpm check` 220 files / 4,814 tests, lint, typecheck, migration smoke and build. Diff check passed. Hosted CI and independent review are pending on the updated PR head. Production remains degraded with `CATALOG_DIAGNOSTICS`; no production read, mutation or deployment was performed in this continuation. Next: push, obtain exact PR-head CI and independent review, protected merge and exact-main CI. The new diagnostic then needs production Environment approval; 0039 migration and rollout remain blocked.

# Production D1 diagnostic continuation — 2026-09-29

PR #25 final prior head `d2e481e75e652262310ac0db5cc3bf324397c08e` passed hosted CI run `36567679646`, with zero GitHub reviews. Main remains `8072e0fea9f8f3588426969007dda06cadbbfbb7`. Fresh public production readiness still shows old Worker `136cb6ff3d2921eac237c7b106b37ab5ee12a13f`, D1/0/cutover true but global static and `CATALOG_DIAGNOSTICS`; staging serves main with global D1 and no fallback. This continuation changes only the unmerged diagnostic workflow and its test: it now checks the authenticated Cloudflare account from `whoami` before remote D1 access, matching the production certification workflow. Focused tests 6/6 PASS; full local and hosted final-head checks are pending. No production mutation, merge or deploy. Next: complete gates, secure independent GitHub review, merge through protected flow, exact-main CI, then dispatch read-only diagnostics via production Environment approval. 0039 migration and rollout remain stopped.

# Production D1 diagnostic PR checkpoint — 2026-09-29

PR #25 is open from `codex/production-d1-diagnostics`. Implementation commit `ad30b7efeac7a4db71665a318fb4869396e4ce98` passed hosted PR CI run `36566901147` and local `pnpm check` (220 files / 4,813 tests, lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build). This follow-up changes documentation only; final-head CI and independent review remain required. Exact main remains `8072e0fea9f8f3588426969007dda06cadbbfbb7`; `FINAL_RELEASE_SHA=UNSET`. Next: review/merge PR #25 through protected flow, obtain exact-main CI, then dispatch only the read-only D1 diagnostic with production Environment approval. Do not apply 0039 or deploy while D1 fallback and migration mismatch persist. No production mutation was performed.

# Unified production release train handoff — 2026-09-29

`codex/production-d1-diagnostics` starts from main `8072e0fea9f8f3588426969007dda06cadbbfbb7` in isolated checkout `/Users/tunbee27/Documents/Tako-san-release-checkout`. Production certification run `36563767379` passed Worker version/deployment and D1 binding proof under production Environment approval, but stopped at the missing `0039_meal_composition_v2.sql` ledger entry. Public readiness independently reports `CATALOG_DIAGNOSTICS` fallback while configured D1/0/cutover true. No production mutation was made.

The branch proposes `.github/workflows/production-d1-diagnostics.yml`, `scripts/production-d1-diagnostics.mjs`, two unit tests, a one-line post-apply proof repair in `.github/workflows/production-d1-migrate.yml`, and `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/PRODUCTION_0039_MIGRATION_PACKET.md`. The diagnostic runs five guarded SELECTs after exact-main, production Environment and D1 identity checks and uploads counts/code categories only. It is diagnostic, not release certification. The packet is prepared, not authorization to apply.

Executed local checks: `pnpm lint` PASS; `pnpm typecheck` PASS; five-file focused Vitest 305/305 PASS; `pnpm check:migrations` PASS; `pnpm build` PASS; `NODE_OPTIONS=--no-experimental-webstorage pnpm test` 220 files/4,812 tests PASS; `git diff --check` PASS. First typecheck failed on missing sparse source folders; first full test attempt had 17 fixture/timeout failures. After expanding sparse paths, targeted 48/48 and final full suite passed. No hosted CI on this branch yet.

Next action: push reviewable PR, get independent review and hosted CI, merge through protected main. Then rerun exact-main gates and request production Environment approval for the new read-only diagnostic. Use failure codes to address catalog hydration; recheck ledger and migration packet before any 0039 apply. Do not dispatch production mutation or deploy while either blocker persists. `FINAL_RELEASE_SHA=UNSET`.

# Scan/OCR handoff — 2026-09-29

PR #22 was reviewed at `439451afeb81aee732c3e7d13acaf0a194b1e70e`, merged as `94056d29ed00a1000e65eb8e1348384638bc02af`, and passed exact-main CI run `36476834182` / job `109112533990` (216 files / 4,804 tests, lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build). Official staging deploy run `36477693577` succeeded on that SHA; production job was skipped. Staging serves AI mock with DB/Queue ready, recipe canary 1%, T20 true. Guest quota API covered 5 ready scans, 6th quota rejection, replay and tenancy. Direct D1 ledger, provider failure, retry exhaustion and no-job fault injection remain unverified on staging.

This follow-up branch `codex/scan-synthetic-ocr-certification` is based on the merge SHA and has local focused 28/28 plus full `pnpm check` PASS. It adds 4 deterministic fictitious receipts/16 variants and a source-first manifest. Apple Vision local baseline achieved 100% normalized names, quantity/unit, line prices and totals with 194-512 ms per image; Qwen OCR was not run. The branch also removes `trứng` and `mozzarella` as incorrect canonical aliases and exposes `X-Request-Id` to trusted CORS origins. Follow-up changes are not in the staging deploy above.

Next: obtain hosted CI and independent review for the follow-up PR before any merge. A dedicated non-production Qwen environment with isolated data resources and approved secret/configuration is needed for real OCR certification. The four original QA images and independently transcribed `qa/ocr/expected.json` are still unavailable; do not infer them from the old incident report. See `docs/ai/scan/SCAN_OCR_REMEDIATION_CERTIFICATION.md`, `qa/ocr/synthetic/README.md`, and `qa/ocr/README.md`. Status: `REAL_QWEN_STAGING_CERTIFICATION_BLOCKED_CONFIGURATION`, `LIVE_OCR_CERTIFICATION_BLOCKED_DATASET_UNAVAILABLE`, production `NOT_READY_FOR_PRODUCTION`. No production deployment or data mutation.

# Historical handoff — Scan/OCR/AI quota remediation (2026-09-28)

PR #22 (`takovn2/Tako-san`) contains the async quota, UI taxonomy, support ID, canonical ingredient, queue fencing/retry, and OCR harness changes. A follow-up review fixed replay of a terminal failed scan after queue-intent persistence fails before a job row exists. The same key now returns `SCAN_FAILED`/503 without reserving quota or sending work; a new key explicitly starts a new attempt. Regression is in `tests/integration/scan-async-quota-lifecycle.test.ts`. No migration or production configuration change.

Final unfiltered `pnpm check` PASS: 216 files / 4,804 tests, typecheck, ESLint, migration smoke, build. First full run timed out one unrelated AI provider test at five seconds; focused 23/23 and second full 4,804/4,804 passed. `git diff --check` and `node --check scripts/ocr-benchmark.mjs` passed. Staging read-only health/ready returned 200 and reported SHA `12348efd015ae72337fbeb08651150a7d28ee638`, database/queue ok, AI mock. Deploy workflow permits reviewed main SHAs only; this PR was not deployed. No live staging scan certification is claimed.

Private dataset requirements and runnable fixture tests: `qa/ocr/README.md`; schema: `qa/ocr/expected.schema.json`. The four originals and independent ground truth are missing. `node scripts/ocr-benchmark.mjs prepare --dataset qa/ocr` returns `DATASET_UNAVAILABLE`; live gate remains `LIVE_OCR_CERTIFICATION_BLOCKED_DATASET_UNAVAILABLE`. No production receipt, PII, synthetic QA image, or invented ground truth was used.

Implementation head `45b6115f5b8bbf54f44182ae8bd9e28d49fa3e8a` passed hosted CI run `36437178487` / job `108977987256`: ESLint, typecheck, Vitest (216 files), migration smoke, and build. Next: verify the current PR head remains green and obtain independent review. A later release owner can stage a reviewed main release under the existing gate, but staging's AI mock cannot certify actual Qwen OCR. The operator must provide the private four-image dataset and ground truth before live OCR scoring. Do not merge or deploy production in this task. Recommendation: `NOT_READY_FOR_PRODUCTION`.

# Handoff — T19 cooking hard-restriction hotfix (2026-09-28)

**Status: `T19_COOKING_HARD_RESTRICTION_HOTFIX_READY_FOR_REVIEW`.** Branch
`fix/t19-cooking-hard-restriction-bypass` from exact main
`85660fa497f3da7110a07ec2189309fbef81d701` (not yet pushed at handoff time).

Problem: `cook/start` and `cook/complete` could be called directly to bypass
household hard restrictions already enforced by the planner and T20
Manual/Assisted/Auto. Fix: new `src/worker/services/cooking-hard-restrictions.ts`
evaluates the canonical `evaluateHardRestrictions` (fail-closed) before any
success response (`cook/start`) or durable mutation (`cook/complete`, after the
idempotent-replay lookup on both legacy and adopted-lot paths). Facts reuse
`candidateRestrictionFacts` over the served authority recipe: static authority
uses the recipe only (no D1 planner enrichment); D1 adds `prep_time_minutes`,
`recipe_classifications`, and the canonical nutrition evidence provider.
Response contract matches T20: 422 `HARD_CONSTRAINT_CONFLICT`.

Local gates: regression 15/15 PASS (9 failed before fix, proving the bug);
nearby authority/T20 suites 50/50 PASS; worker typecheck clean; eslint clean.
No D1 catalog mutation, no migration, no secret/config/rollout change, no
staging or production deploy. Staging remains canary 1% — do NOT promote.

Next: push branch, open PR `fix(t19): enforce hard restrictions at cooking
boundary`, await review and merge. After merge, the T19 rollout restarts from
shadow on the new main SHA (fresh D1 proof required; old evidence stale).

# Handoff — T19 staging canary-1 observation / canary-5 attempt (2026-09-28)

**Status: `T19_CANARY_5_BLOCKED_WORKFLOW_DISPATCH_FORBIDDEN`.** Main
`85660fa497f3`. Staging serves `canary / 1 / true` from Deploy `36385014725` and
was not changed. The agent GitHub App has `actions: read` only.
`gh workflow run` returned HTTP 403 before and after credential rotation, so
Staging D1 Runtime Readiness and Deploy could not be dispatched. The last
readiness certification (`36364583331`, 01:05Z) predates the canary and is not
fresh.

Fresh evidence: public `/health/ready` matches canary/1/true, `mixed`,
`rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`, fallback null, commit main. Outside-cohort live smoke with 3 new
registered staging test accounts passed (85 requests, 0 HTTP 500, 0 unexpected
404). D1-only recipes were fenced (422/404) and static authority was consistent
across every flow. Not run: inside-cohort (no in-cohort household without
test-cohort secrets or mass registration), cook complete, dietary/allergen/nutrition
restrictions, and fresh protected authority fields. The test accounts were not
cleaned up, and no identifiers were recorded.

Observation: the staging Deploy job does not call `validateRecipeCatalogTransition()`;
only production does. Next: grant `actions: write` or dispatch manually, run fresh
readiness, decide how to get inside-cohort evidence, then run the staging canary/5
Deploy (see receipt `recipe-catalog/T19_STAGING_CANARY_5_RECEIPT.md`). No
production action.

# Handoff — T19-R0 staging D1 runtime readiness certifier (2026-09-27)

`scripts/staging-d1-runtime-readiness-check.mjs` and
`.github/workflows/staging-d1-runtime-readiness.yml`. The checker reuses
`hydrateRuntimeRecipes` + `assessD1Readiness` against the committed catalog
release manifest, plus pinned staging D1 identity `frigo-db-staging-v3` /
`7854298a-20f5-46aa-9cbf-917079c2a3dd`, ledger tip `0039_meal_composition_v2.sql`, approved-batch
provenance, and FK/quick_check. Workflow is `workflow_dispatch` only,
`environment: staging`, concurrency `frigo-deploy-staging`. No deploy,
`d1 migrations apply`, authority change, T20 change, or 0040.

Local gates: focused 31/31; `pnpm check` PASS. Do not dispatch the new
workflow until merge + exact-main CI. Do not claim remote staging D1
runtime readiness certified from this PR.

the hard-rule fixture. Source inspection is not a live rejection test.
No unsafe component was proven persisted. Post-smoke D1 PRAGMA and Worker

# Handoff — T20 live staging planner prerequisite PR #17 (2026-09-27)

**Status: `T20_STAGING_PLANNER_PR17_REVIEW_PENDING`.** Main and live
staging Worker are `b44e9355ce8988e7acb7c3b12c55bc2b27340e1a`.
Deploy `36305024017` succeeded with T20 Worker/UI flags true, static
recipe authority (served 71), and production skipped. Two registered
staging test accounts exist: A `usr_1790496416217_u02mk` /
`hh_usr_1790496416217_u02mk`, B `usr_1790496420287_ajiz4` /
`hh_usr_1790496420287_ajiz4`; secret sessions remain only in a local
mode-0600 temporary file.

Live unauthenticated picker was 401 as expected; authenticated picker
was 404 `MEAL_PLANNER_DISABLED`, so the T20 live matrix has not started
and no plan exists. Operator authorized staging-only
`MEAL_PLANNER_ENABLED=true` and `VITE_MEAL_PLANNER_ENABLED=true`.
PR #17 at `7c8b6d8b548872b95c2695862e7bd1a962ad7701` implements
these flags and a release prerequisite guard. Production config, T20
enablement, recipe authority, migration ledger and D1 catalog are
unchanged. Local focused 20/20, lint, typecheck, staging-style build and
migration smoke pass. Local full check had the known Wrangler catch-up
timeout (4,726/4,727); hosted PR CI `36305647997` is in progress.

Next: verify exact-head hosted CI and independent review/merge. Then
verify exact-main CI, dispatch only staging Deploy with T20=true/static/0
and production=false, and check live SHA before exercising the original
full live matrix. Production/T19/0040 are forbidden in this task.
Do not report source tests as live certification.

# Handoff — T20 staging account fix PR #16 (2026-09-27)

**Status: `T20_STAGING_PR16_REVIEW_PENDING`.** Main and live staging Worker
remain `dff7446855964d9fc60008c370ef656371652a13`. PR #16 on
`codex/t20-staging-turnstile` has implementation head
`ef5ebd8a5c3d52475c0951b83a0bb6a6ca2eef06`. Hosted pull-request CI run
`36299373601` SUCCESS: lint, typecheck, 208/4,725 Vitest, migration smoke,
build. Final documentation checkpoint CI must be verified after push.

The PR fixes staging registration with the official Turnstile test pair and
makes Deploy manual-only to avoid automatic T20=false rollback on merge.
Existing release gates still require current main, exact-SHA hosted CI,
staging authority proof, paired T20 flags and production confirmation. See
ADR-035/036 and the PR description. Local full Vitest had one unrelated
Wrangler D1 catch-up timeout; hosted CI passed it.

No live registered User A/B or T20 plan exists. No deploy, Worker var, D1,
recipe-authority, production, T19 or 0040 change was made. Next: independent
review/merge; successful exact-main CI; manual staging-only dispatch with
T20=true/static/0; then verify Worker identity, create User A/B and execute
the original full LIVE certification. Do not merge or dispatch from this handoff
without the required review/release decision.

# Handoff — T20 staging account fix and release gate (2026-09-27)

**Status: `T20_STAGING_FIX_BRANCH_READY_DEPLOY_BLOCKED_RELEASE_GATE`.** Canonical
main `dff7446855964d9fc60008c370ef656371652a13`; implementation commit
`027c628` on `codex/t20-staging-turnstile`. T20 remains enabled on staging;
Worker still serves `dff7446`. No live registered User A/B or T20 plan exists.

Change: `src/worker/utils/turnstile.ts` pairs only the exact staging test site
key with the official test secret and still calls Siteverify. Missing token or
failed provider response is rejected. Other staging site keys require a secret;
production behavior is unchanged. Unit/integration tests and ADR-035 document
the scope. A mismatched live Worker secret is the leading, unproven diagnosis.

Executed checks: focused Vitest 2/106 PASS; canonical exact-main clone
`pnpm check` PASS (208/4,724, lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build),
`git diff --check` PASS. Initial managed-worktree full run had two failures;
at least one was confirmed due to its stale old-repository `origin/main`. The
identical code passed the canonical clone.

Release obstacle: Deploy workflow requires a reviewed exact-head SHA on main,
with hosted CI. Direct main push triggers automatic staging deploy with
T20=false by default, violating the requirement to keep T20 on. Do not push
main directly, dispatch an off-flag release, or bypass the release gate. A
release-operator decision is needed for a safe staged sequence preserving both
T20 flags true. Once deployed, verify new SHA, register User A/B, and run the
full LIVE T20 matrix. No staging deploy, Worker var, D1, production, T19, or
0040 mutation was performed.

# Handoff — T20-R1 staging release observability convergence (2026-09-27)

**Status: `T20_RELEASE_OBSERVABILITY_FIX_IN_REVIEW`.** Do not deploy, do not
enable T20, do not merge from an agent.

Base: main `0b2e0a17578bdc744427944b90db5b76bdbfe33c`. Branch
`feat/t20-staging-release-observability`.

Files: `scripts/release-check.mjs` (`verifyPreviousRecipeAuthority`,
`previousWorkerStillAnswering`, shared `STABLE_RECIPE_AUTHORITY_EVIDENCE_FIELDS`,
strict exported `fetchRecipeAuthorityEvidence`, staging-only
`previous-authority` command), `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (one staging step
before deploy), `tests/unit/release-check.test.mjs` (tests A–L, capture proof,
fetch, real-Git CLI, workflow order, production same-SHA exact-capture cases),
`docs/ai/DECISIONS.md` (ADR-034).

Behavior: exact captured previous commit + valid previous state → bounded retry;
target commit + target state → pass; unknown/malformed/wrong evidence → fail
closed; previous Worker never converging → fail at 90 s.

Next: review/merge → exact-main CI → flag-OFF staging Deploy re-prove (full
SUCCESS incl. protected authority proof) → only then a separate T20=true staging
rollout. Production untouched.

---

# Handoff — T20 staging rollout preflight (2026-09-27)

**Status: `T20_STAGING_BLOCKED_RELEASE_OBSERVABILITY`.** Do not enable T20.
Do not dispatch Deploy. Do not touch production.

Main `0b2e0a17578bdc744427944b90db5b76bdbfe33c` (unmoved). CI `36284857635`
SUCCESS. Staging 0039 run `36287079403` / artifact `10919819859` /
`STAGING_0039_CERTIFIED`. Flags OFF in `wrangler.jsonc` and
`wrangler.staging.jsonc`.

T20 runtime (flags off) certified locally: candidate cap 320, shared T03
`evaluateHardRestrictions` for Manual/Assisted/Auto/save/apply, simple foods
fail-closed, T19 authority, 500-recipe picker, persistence, IDOR, stale 409,
shopping. Focused T20 120 PASS; Vitest 208/4654 PASS; lint/typecheck/migrations/
build PASS. No code changes.

Blocker: Deploy `36285175574` failed `release-check.mjs authority` after smoke
PASS (`recipe-authority.commit` `8147dde8…` != release SHA). Same SHA T20
enablement would hit the same gate after Worker deploy.

Next: reconcile staging recipe-authority commit identity, then staging-only
Deploy with paired T20 flags. Do not start production.

# Handoff — Staging D1 0033→0038 historical catch-up PR

**Remediation (2026-09-27): `STAGING_D1_0033_0038_CATCHUP_PR_REMEDIATED_READY_FOR_REVIEW`.**
PR #14 review P1 fixed in `f14fcb4` / tests `50e973c`: before every mutation
the pre-tip (or the target in certify-only mode) must pass `certifyCheckpoint`
— exact ordered IDs, slugs and provenance, runtime_order 0..n-1, runtime and
ingredient-order coverage, child counts, media seed + exact index/trigger/MIME/
storage-key schema (0035+), approved batch provenance/marker (0036+),
onboarding schema (0038), FK/quick_check. `plan` refuses an uncertified
pre-state, and the apply step starts with `apply-gate` (certified pre-state,
rechecked ledger/plan, bookmark captured after recheck). P2s:
`GITHUB_REPOSITORY_ID` is required (no fallback); `assertCurrentRunBookmark`
proves run/source/ordering only, not wall-clock freshness. Local gates:
typecheck, lint, migration smoke PASS; Vitest 208 files / 4,654 tests PASS
(+10 hostile pre-state tests). Staging/production mutation: NO.

**Current: `STAGING_D1_0033_0038_CATCHUP_PR_READY`.** Do not dispatch the new
workflow until this PR is reviewed and merged. Do not apply 0039 from catch-up.

Canonical `main`: `8147dde`. Exact-main CI `36274587084` SUCCESS. Deploy
`36274945067` SUCCESS. Implementation `718abef` on
`feat/staging-d1-catchup-0033-0038`.

What landed:
- `.github/workflows/staging-d1-catchup.yml` — `workflow_dispatch` only, staging
  Environment, `confirm_staging_catchup` default false, contents/actions read,
  concurrency `frigo-deploy-staging` (shared with the 0039 workflow).
- `scripts/staging-d1-catchup-check.mjs` — one-step target gate, prefix builder
  (0001…target, never 0039), ephemeral D1-only Wrangler config, exact catalog
  certification from local replay, fresh Time Travel bookmark, production D1
  hard reject.
- Shared `classifyPreLedger` wording is now environment-neutral; behavior
  unchanged.
- Existing 0039 workflow / `PRE_TIP` / `TIP` / Wrangler DB IDs unchanged.

Local gates: typecheck, lint, Vitest 208/4,644, migration smoke, build PASS.
Local replay certified 59 → 71 → 71 → 101 → 500 → 500. Staging mutation was
not performed. Production D1/R2/deploy untouched. T20 remains false.

After merge, execute separately: target 0034, inspect receipt, then 0035, 0036,
0037, 0038. Only then use **Staging D1 Migration** for 0038→0039.

## Resume point

1. Review/merge the catch-up PR. Do not auto-merge.
2. Re-prove staging Cloudflare secrets after the repo transfer.
3. Dispatch catch-up from `main` with exact current main SHA, one target per run.
4. Do not start Content Refresh V2, 0040, or T20 enablement from this path.

# Handoff — Runtime Ingredient Model V2 staging blocker and offline checkpoint

Canonical `main` after PR #11: `8687ff9f3e8f6b6cbf466ee61968bb5f3469498c`.
Exact-main CI `36269257668` SUCCESS (204 files / 4,597 tests, lint,
typecheck, migration smoke, build). The staging-only 0039 workflow was
dispatched once: run `36269963768`, job `108481914553`, exact same SHA. It
failed at the first remote D1 identity read with Cloudflare authentication
error 10000; the reviewed workflow skipped ledger, Time Travel, migration
apply and post-checks. The staging config pins
`frigo-db-staging-v3` / `7854298a-20f5-46aa-9cbf-917079c2a3dd`, but the
remote identity was **not** verified. Do not retry with guessed credentials or
manual SQL. No production D1/media/R2 reads occurred. T20 remains off by
repository config; remote effective flags were not queried.

Offline branch `codex/runtime-ingredient-model-v2` starts from certified main.
Implementation checkpoint: `1c9a585cd39cfd9e3b2b8b8256dbd41ed9878110`.
ADR-033 and `RUNTIME_INGREDIENT_MODEL_V2.md` define the review candidate and
consumer map. The canonical recipe package and source hash
`da87da20475fa8d7ec92c716e899ee572339573258ae6d9cc7f3f8f554f2d695`
are unchanged. New deterministic audit pins that hash and reports 6,766 rows,
3,770 provisionally projected, 2,996 excluded, 2,860 excluded needing review,
136 semantic exclusions, plus 169 already-projected units needing conversion
review. No transformation, ingredient identity, URL or nutrition profile was
promoted. Provisional fingerprint stays
`6d0e3eb85696bb7c31bc54ac62783bc94432aaf008028eca79b17041f3eaed87`;
final fingerprint is absent. `pnpm recipe:refresh:release-check` must still
fail with four blockers. No 0040 or final release manifest exists.

Current local focused model/authority/refresh tests (3 files / 35 tests),
typecheck, lint, source/import/audit checks and final `pnpm check` all passed:
206 files / 4,615 tests, migration smoke and build. PR #12 is OPEN/MERGEABLE;
hosted CI `36271741260` / validate `108486877920` SUCCESS on implementation/docs
head `e321122069c74b2d791cd13d3c7422ed7e02abbe` with 206 files / 4,615
tests, lint, typecheck, migration smoke and build. This final documentation
receipt needs its own exact-head CI. Do not merge as release readiness.
Next: independently review PR #12; separately repair staging
credential and repeat the reviewed workflow before any remote audit or rollout.

# Handoff — Ingredient icon pack v2 (2026-09-27)

**Current (2026-09-27): `ICON_V2_PR_OPEN`.** PR #13
(`feat/ingredient-icons-v2` → `main`) opened; rebased on `origin/main`
`c6ea259` (PR #12) and re-pushed via Git Data API, remote tree
byte-identical to local. Post-rebase local gates: typecheck, lint,
focused icon test 7/7, unit 119 files / 2,478 tests, migration smoke,
build — all PASS. Monitoring hosted CI. No merge, no deploy from this task.

What changed (all additive, no call-site edits — the 8 existing
`getIngredientImage(id, name)` call sites are untouched):
- `public/frigo/ingredients/`: +39 PNG (512px, RGBA transparent):
  15 vegetables (shallot, lemongrass, cilantro, vietnamese-coriander,
  bean-sprouts, bitter-melon, luffa, winter-melon, zucchini, galangal,
  turmeric, leek, mint, pineapple, white-radish), 16 pantry (salt, pepper,
  seasoning-powder, water, flour, peanut, sesame, honey, cooking-wine,
  squid, crab, spare-ribs, oyster-sauce, sesame-oil, rice-paper, vinegar),
  8 generic (category-vegetable/spice/meat/seafood/fruit/grain/dairy/other).
- `src/web/lib/frigo-assets.ts`: 39 new keys + `ingredients.generic` section.
- `src/web/lib/ingredient-icon-rules.json`: 214 ordered rules (new file).
- `src/web/lib/ingredient-images.ts`: data-driven matcher replacing the
  if-chain; new optional 3rd param `category` for the fallback.
- `tests/unit/ingredient-images.test.ts`: 7 tests (new file).

Verification: `pnpm typecheck` PASS, `pnpm lint` PASS, `pnpm build` PASS,
`pnpm check:migrations` PASS, focused
`vitest run tests/unit/ingredient-images.test.ts` 7/7 PASS,
`vitest run tests/unit` 116 files / 2,460 tests PASS (pre-rebase),
post-rebase: 119 files / 2,478 tests PASS (incl. 18 new PR #12 tests),
`vitest run tests/integration` chunk 1 of 4 (22 files) 1,138 passed /
8 skipped, 0 failed. The sandbox pauses long execs for user confirmation,
so integration chunks 2–4 were not run locally; no integration/e2e test
covers the icon modules. Hosted PR CI is the final full-suite gate.

Known design decisions (audited, do not "fix" without review):
- Unaccented names never guess: 11 ambiguous normalized forms are dropped
  from phase 2, and phase 1 skips bare ambiguous keywords (`me`, `chao`)
  for unaccented input.
- Grouped keywords (ngao, hương thảo, kỷ tử, pate, đá viên…) resolve to
  truthful *category* icons, never to a wrong specific icon.

Boundaries respected: no PayOS/payment/billing/checkout/webhook, auth,
migration, deploy, or production D1/R2 change.

## Resume point

1. PR #13 is open: https://github.com/tako-vn2/Tako-san/pull/13
   (`feat/ingredient-icons-v2` → `main`, head `95e21c2e`).
2. Watch hosted exact-head CI; report green/red to Tun bee.
3. Require reviewer `vn-taphoanhatung` + Tun bee's separate approval
   before any merge. No merge/deploy from this task.

# Historical handoff — Recipe Content Refresh V2 PR #11 remediation

**Current (2026-09-27): `RECIPE_REFRESH_V2_RESEARCH_CANONICALIZED`; release projection blocked.**
Implementation commit `1f77902` contains the remediated source, compiler,
validators, generated artifacts and tests. Starting PR head was
`fbec18f1e2554068ec550c7a9b5c9afcd4da0b79`; starting main was
`c81d6da2b3a9c051270b97953bfbb2c5aa34d057`.
The source package is rebuilt from the original ZIP. It contains 500 IDs,
4,938 steps and 6,766 ingredients. The provisional runtime fingerprint remains
`6d0e3eb85696bb7c31bc54ac62783bc94432aaf008028eca79b17041f3eaed87`;
the canonical source SHA-256 is
`da87da20475fa8d7ec92c716e899ee572339573258ae6d9cc7f3f8f554f2d695`
(previously `fc7eefe6573ee9de1083728db1f34b058954fa60ff478f7c5e41dce9e4570dbe`).
No final release fingerprint exists. The manifest explicitly blocks release
for runtime projection loss, provisional ingredient authority, incomplete
source content verification, and nutrition evidence.
`pnpm recipe:refresh:release-check` must fail with
`RECIPE_REFRESH_RELEASE_BLOCKED`; `pnpm recipe:refresh:check` must pass.
Of 2,996 excluded ingredient rows, 2,860 require reviewed transformation;
136 are currently semantic exclusions. Reconciliation rows: 505 existing,
0 reviewed new, 1,642 provisional new, 368 aliases. Declared URLs: 1,101;
structurally valid URLs including one supporting source: 1,102;
URL-specific content verification: 0. Nutrition: 1 publishable, 288 blocked,
211 truthful null. Production rollout, 0040, recipe authority and T20 remain
out of scope.

Local verification: `git diff --check`, `pnpm recipe:refresh:check`,
`pnpm recipe:import:check`, focused refresh tests (17/17), `pnpm typecheck`,
`pnpm lint` and `pnpm check` passed (204 files / 4,597 tests, migration smoke,
build). The release check intentionally exited 1 with all four typed blockers.
Two fresh builds from the original ZIP reproduced the source artifact hash and
provisional fingerprint; sampled generated files matched byte for byte.
PR #11 was pushed at `dea13cddb0c153d325baa593700545d801c9e851` and
remains OPEN/MERGEABLE. Hosted CI run `36268138066` on that exact head passed
ESLint, typecheck, 204 files / 4,597 tests, migration smoke and web/worker
build. The PR description has the same blocker/remote-boundary receipt.

Next: verify hosted CI on this final documentation receipt, then hand PR #11
to independent review without merging. Hoplite next reconciles the runtime/
content model and evidence before any release artifact generation.

## Historical pre-remediation handoff (superseded)

**Previously reported (2026-09-27): `RECIPE_REFRESH_V2_CANONICAL_SOURCE_READY`.** Canonical
repository `tako-vn/Tako-san`, base `origin/main`
`c81d6da2b3a9c051270b97953bfbb2c5aa34d057`, branch
`codex/recipe-content-refresh-v2-canonical`, pushed implementation checkpoint
`fc5e713e10e0b63c890ba31fc29d9678be896ed7`.

## Resume point

The 500-file canonical source is complete at `data/recipe-refresh/v2`; audit
artifacts are at `artifacts/recipe-refresh-v2`; schema/runtime decisions and
known evidence gaps are in `AUDIT_REPORT.md` and ADR-032. Input ZIP SHA-256:
`ebc18f06ee7fb4498f8cd2a7886f333a85b385f32af4407ae1b44b4ec3cc06fe`.
Canonical artifact SHA-256:
`fc7eefe6573ee9de1083728db1f34b058954fa60ff478f7c5e41dce9e4570dbe`.
Runtime fingerprint:
`6d0e3eb85696bb7c31bc54ac62783bc94432aaf008028eca79b17041f3eaed87`.

Audit truth: 500 recipes / IDs, 4,938 steps, 6,766 ingredient lines, 15 raw
root variants, 6,743 quantified and 23 qualitative canonical rows, 166
process-only and 7 mixed-process rows, 3,770 projected and 2,996 excluded
runtime ingredient rows. Source coverage is 499 recipes with at least two
relevant URLs plus the explicit `imp-0d6c454ae1073ef6` exception. Ingredient
reconciliation has 505 existing IDs, 1,642 new reviewed IDs, 368 duplicate
aliases, and no ambiguous/invalid rows.

Nutrition outcome: 289 source numeric profiles, 353 recomputed candidates, 1
certified publishable profile, 288 blocked, 211 truthful null. Blocked/null
nutrition never projects runtime macros. Salt-bed and deep-frying outliers are
quarantined by evidence policy, not clipped. Runtime still uses positive
`StandardUnit` quantities and canonical IDs; richer qualitative/process data
stays in source instead of weakening planner/inventory/shopping contracts.

Verification on the final documentation tree: `pnpm recipe:refresh:check`,
`pnpm recipe:import:check`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `git diff --check`,
focused refresh 11/11, and `pnpm check` PASS; full Vitest is 204 files / 4,591
tests. The first full run failed only because managed sparse-checkout omitted
tracked `public/`; adding it back restored all assets, after which the 24
CSP/PWA brand tests and complete gate passed. No repository file was repaired
or fabricated for that checkout issue.

## Next exact action

Open/review the PR and require hosted exact-head CI. Do not merge or perform a
remote rollout in this task. A later authorized release task may generate the
Content Refresh V2 manifest and `0040_recipe_content_refresh_v2.sql` from the
pinned source, then certify staging before production.

# Historical handoff — T20 release gate

**Latest (2026-09-26):** PR #9 MERGED at `cb22cfb`, exact-main CI green;
local OAuth and read-only live staging D1 identity now match reviewed config,
not the operator packet's Section 0 ID. The next handoff is current; later
entries are historical.

## T20 staging D1 migration preflight handoff — 2026-09-26 UTC

### Owner-approved Cloudflare login and read-only identity receipt

`pnpm dlx wrangler@4.119.0 login --device --browser=false --scopes
account:read user:read d1:write` succeeded after owner approval (Wrangler
4.119.0 was disposable, not added to repository dependencies). Both this
version and the repository Wrangler 3.114.17 report authenticated via
`CI=true pnpm exec wrangler whoami`; before login, the repository command
exited 0 but actually printed "You are not authenticated". Read-only
`CI=true pnpm exec wrangler d1 list --json` and `CI=true pnpm exec wrangler
d1 info frigo-db-staging-v3 --config wrangler.staging.jsonc --json` PASS:
one matching staging name, with remote ID equal to `wrangler.staging.jsonc`
and packet Phase B, but unequal to packet Section 0. The identity discrepancy
is resolved for local read-only staging identification, not by guessing from
the packet. No staging ledger/schema/bookmark/row query, migration, deploy or
flag enablement occurred; production was untouched. Next: review PR #10 and
its exact-head CI, then verify the GitHub staging Environment credential and
run reviewed read-only gates on merged exact-main before applying 0039.
Local OAuth does not certify GitHub staging Environment access.

### State and checkpoints

`origin/main` `cb22cfb` contains PR #9. Exact-main hosted CI `36240577660`
validate job `108400172569` SUCCESS (202 files / 4,574 tests, lint,
typecheck, migration smoke and build). Automatic Deploy `36240842196`:
release and staging SUCCESS, production SKIPPED. This is flag-OFF/static
staging and not T20 staging certification. Local Wrangler 3.114.17 is not
authenticated; `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` were
absent. The operator packet Section 0 D1 ID conflicts with its Phase B
expected ID; `wrangler.staging.jsonc` matches Phase B. Do not infer which
remote D1 is safe: no remote identity, ledger, bookmark, FK, data or schema
query was made. No staging migration, staging D1-mode/T20-ON deploy, or
staging E2E occurred.

### Verification and failures

`git fetch --all --prune`, `git diff --check`, `pnpm check:migrations`
(`migration-smoke=ok`) PASS. Added a staging-only, manual-dispatch 0039
migration workflow and checker that fail closed on exact current main/hosted
CI, reviewed config identity, production ID exclusion, ledger and plan,
Time Travel bookmark, 500-recipe baseline, pre/post FK/quick checks,
0039 constraints and repository schema gate. The workflow shares staging's
deploy concurrency group; production migration/deploy files are untouched.
Executed `pnpm exec vitest run
tests/unit/staging-d1-migration-check.test.mjs
tests/unit/production-certify-workflow.test.mjs
tests/integration/d1-schema-gate.test.ts`: 3 files / 63 tests PASS;
`pnpm exec eslint scripts/staging-d1-migration-check.mjs
tests/unit/staging-d1-migration-check.test.mjs` PASS. The first targeted run
failed parsing a typo in the new test; the next failed because a test parsed
JSONC as JSON. Both issues were corrected and the final focused rerun passed. On initial
workflow checkpoint `9635ad6`, local `pnpm check` PASS (203 files / 4,580
tests, lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build); hosted PR #10 CI run
`36241921150` validate SUCCESS. Independent review found two P2 gaps in
this new workflow: schema checks did not require FK cascades, and the tests
did not lock preflight D1 commands to read-only SQL. The follow-up now checks
exact FK targets/cascades and unique index columns; tests fail on removed
cascades/changed index and constrain pre-apply SQL. Re-executed the same 3
files / 63 tests PASS and targeted ESLint PASS. This later review-fix/docs
checkpoint needs its own hosted CI. All checks above are local/hosted tests,
not remote staging D1 evidence.

### Next action / release boundary

Have a reviewer reconcile the staging D1 ID against the real staging account,
review and merge PR #10 only after its exact-head CI; verify exact-main CI on the merged
workflow SHA. Dispatch the workflow only on current main with staged credentials
and confirmation; it must certify identity and 0039 before any T20 deploy.
If auth/identity/ledger fails, stop without ad-hoc SQL. Subsequently run the
staging-only D1-500/T20-OFF deploy and baseline, then same-SHA V2-ON deploy,
full E2E and rollback proof. This task stopped safe before remote D1 mutation;
`staging_migration=NO`, `staging_v2_enablement=NO`,
`production_migration=NO`, `production_deploy=NO`,
`production_recipe_authority_change=NO`, `production_enablement=NO`,
`production_mutation=NO`.

**Latest (2026-09-26):** PR #8 MERGED, exact-main CI green; PR #9 C8 `8814701`
is synced/retargeted to `main`, and docs head `cffd959` passed hosted CI. The
next handoff is current; older entries are history.

## T20 C8 sync and C10 certification handoff — 2026-09-26 UTC

### State and checkpoints

`origin/main` `662a065` is PR #8's merge commit; hosted CI `36237334354`
validate SUCCESS. Deploy `36237637195`: release/staging SUCCESS and
production SKIPPED, not T20 flag-on staging certification. PR #9 is OPEN,
head C8 `8814701` (main merged into branch without rewrite), base `main`,
merge-base `662a065`. Earlier C5 `ab83d35`/`5c6835e`/`6c68d8d`, C6
`092d67b`/`869f035`, C7 `869f035` and docs `24437e0` remain intact.
No C9 fix was needed; final docs-only checkpoint follows full C10 local gate.

### Verification and limits

`git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` PASS. Post-sync focused `pnpm exec
vitest run` over the five T20 integration files, two T19 authority files
and three T20 unit files listed in the previous handoff: 10 files / 112
tests PASS. Explicit `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint` and post-sync `pnpm check`
PASS: 202 files / 4,574 tests, migration smoke and web/Worker build. Hosted
PR #9 C8 head `8814701` CI run `36238249061`, validate job `108393884945`
SUCCESS: lint, typecheck, 202 files / 4,574 tests, migration smoke and build.
The later docs-only checkpoint requires its own exact-head hosted CI; no claim
of merge readiness until it and review clearance are confirmed. The
post-sync diff has only PR #9 runtime changes/tests/docs, not migration 0039,
workflow, secrets, production configuration, recipe authority or recipe count.

Docs head `cffd959` exact-head hosted run `36239282586`, validate job
`108396637996` SUCCESS (ESLint, typecheck, full Vitest, local SQLite migration
smoke, web/Worker build). Re-executed `pnpm exec vitest run
tests/integration/t20-meal-composition-stale-read.test.ts
tests/integration/t20-legacy-family-and-safety.test.ts` at `cffd959`: 2 files /
24 tests PASS. `git fetch origin main fix/t20-postmerge-ci-picker-cuisine--hardening`
and `git merge-base --is-ancestor origin/main HEAD` confirmed remote/base
ancestry; the hosted run, local HEAD and remote PR head matched. `gh pr view 9`
and GraphQL review-thread query showed OPEN, MERGEABLE/CLEAN and zero unresolved
threads. The new documentation receipt is itself a new head, requiring fresh
exact-head CI; no failures remain in the completed checks listed here.

### Next action / release boundary

Obtain exact-final-head hosted PR #9 CI SUCCESS on this docs-only receipt
(lint/typecheck/Vitest/migration smoke/build), zero unresolved review threads
and MERGEABLE/CLEAN before offering PR #9 for maintainer merge. Stop before
merging PR #9. Staging identity/ledger and a
reviewed T20 staging migration/deploy remain a separate later gate; keep
both T20 flags OFF. `staging_migration=NO`, `staging_deploy=NO` for this task;
`production_migration=NO`, `production_deploy=NO`,
`production_enablement=NO`.

`validate` `36233377483` SUCCESS. PR #9 remains stacked on #8 at `869f035`;
the branch does not contain #8's final docs-only head yet. No PR merged or
closed. Current C5 checkpoints: `ab83d35` (edited-slot affected suffix),
`5c6835e` (later slots sharing the projection), `6c68d8d` (V1 family and
evidence-sensitive safety key). C6: `092d67b` (missing-slot precedence),
`869f035` (concurrent slot creation). C7 code-freeze SHA is `869f035`;
the documentation checkpoint follows separately. No known unfixed P0/P1/P2
from the focused audit; production substitution policy was not inferred from
injected test fixtures.

### Verification and failures

On `869f035`, `pnpm check` PASS: typecheck, lint, 202 files / 4,574 Vitest
tests, `migration-smoke=ok`, build. `pnpm exec vitest run` of
`tests/integration/t20-{meal-composition-stale-read,legacy-family-and-safety,meal-composition-http,meal-composition-flows,roles-picker-shopping}.test.ts`,
`tests/integration/t19-{recipe-authority-split,planner-authority-persistence}.test.ts`,
and `tests/unit/t20-{meal-composer-ui.test.tsx,composition-shopping.test.ts,composition-safety.test.ts}`:
10 files / 112 tests PASS. `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, and `git diff
--check origin/main...HEAD` independently PASS. New deterministic tests
confirmed the cross-slot, V1 family and slot-creation bugs as expected-red
before their fixes; all are now green. Two earlier `pnpm check` runs were
interrupted (exit 130) when further findings required changes; neither is
counted as final evidence. Hosted PR #9 checks remain absent while stacked
under non-main #8; staging/production were not exercised.

### Release blockers and next action

Maintainer: merge PR #8 through the protected PR flow and confirm exact-main
SHA/CI. Then fetch and merge the updated main into PR #9 (avoid dropping its
checkpoints; resolve documentation overlap), retarget #9 to `main`, and require
exact-head hosted lint/typecheck/Vitest/migration-smoke/build SUCCESS, zero
unresolved threads and mergeability. Only then may a maintainer merge #9 and
verify exact-main CI. Staging D1 identity, ledger and rollback bookmark still
need authorized verification before any staging migration/deploy. Keep both
T20 flags OFF. `staging_migration=NO`, `staging_deploy=NO`,
`production_migration=NO`, `production_deploy=NO`,
`production_enablement=NO`. Do not claim T20 production completion.

## T20 PR #8 CI fix — lock/regenerate race, 2026-09-26 UTC

Final PR #8 readiness receipt (2026-09-26 UTC): base `main` `bf57451`
(`bf57451e4a1a047eeff7a0938b903d1a37b6f8c9`), last main CI `36221190222` failed in the pre-#8 race test;
PR #8 remote head `5b0a6b9` (`5b0a6b995786b338999286023eb2e46de4bc45a7`), hosted full `validate`
`36226026618` SUCCESS. MERGEABLE/CLEAN, no unresolved human review threads,
working tree clean. Executed `pnpm exec vitest run

tests/integration/t20-roles-picker-shopping.test.ts
tests/unit/t20-meal-composer-ui.test.tsx
tests/integration/t20-meal-composition-http.test.ts` — 4 files / 37 PASS;
`git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` PASS. Diff/config audit: no PR #8
migrations, environment or secret requirements, infrastructure, deploy/CI
workflow, production backfill or new flag; the pre-existing T20 flags default
OFF. PR #8 is ready for an intermediate normal merge, not T20 production
enablement. PR #9 contains the separately tested torn-read, same-slot safety
and stale-picker fixes and remains stacked on #8. No migration or deploy was
run. Next: maintainer merges #8 via PR flow, verifies exact-main CI, retargets
#9 to main and requires its exact-head hosted CI before merging #9. Do not
direct-push main or change production.

---

PR #8 hosted `validate` run `36225377465` failed 1/4554:
`competing lock/regenerate` got `[200, 404]`. Regenerate won; the losing PATCH
targeted the unlocked legacy component, which the winning regenerate replaced.
Test-only fix (`754fb2e`): the race
now targets the locked rice component, which regenerate preserves by ID, so the
loser always reaches the revision fence (409 `PLAN_REVISION_CONFLICT`); final
state asserted for both winners. Executed: flows file 5/5 runs PASS (16 tests);
throwaway sequential regenerate-then-stale-PATCH check PASS (409, rice still
locked; not committed); `pnpm typecheck` PASS; eslint on the file PASS.

Follow-up finding (production code NOT changed, per scope): `MealCompositionService.load`
reads the plan row and `readPlanCompositions` in separate awaits. A stale
component edit can pass `assertRevision` on the old row, then read a newer
composition and fail with 404 `COMPONENT_NOT_FOUND` before the fenced write.
Writes remain revision-fenced (no data loss); only the error classification is
wrong. Next: reclassify to `PLAN_REVISION_CONFLICT` when the plan revision
moved (or read row + compositions in one batch), with a regression test.

# T20 post-merge CI fix + picker cuisine filter, 2026-09-26 UTC

Branch `fix/t20-postmerge-ci-picker-cuisine` from main `bf57451` (PR #7 merge).
- `87c8e64` (test-only): main CI run `36221190222` failed at
  `tests/integration/t20-meal-composition-flows.test.ts:177` because the
  add/remove race can legitimately be won by DELETE (empty composition) while
  the test assumed `components[0]`. The combined race is split into three
  independent cases; each asserts exactly one 200 + one typed 409
  (`PLAN_REVISION_CONFLICT`; auto-apply losing to a save may be the documented
  `PROPOSAL_STALE`) and a final state matching the winner. DELETE-wins refills
  at the current revision; lock/regenerate and save/auto-apply start from a
  deterministic sequential setup. No production logic changed.
- `65084fc`: T20 picker `cuisine` query (strict enum of existing `CuisineType`
  values), filtered server-side on stored recipe cuisine together with role/q/
  kind; simple foods have no cuisine and are excluded when the filter is set.
  UI: labelled cuisine select and filtered empty state with Clear filters.
  Candidate authority, hard restrictions, composer, shopping, T19 unchanged.

Executed: focused `vitest run` of t20-meal-composer-ui, t20-roles-picker-shopping,
t20-meal-composition-flows, t20-meal-composition-http: 4 files / 37 tests PASS;
flows file 6/6 repeated runs PASS; DELETE-first sequence verified with a
throwaway sequential test (not committed). `pnpm typecheck`, lint PASS.
`pnpm check` on `65084fc`: typecheck, lint PASS; vitest 4,552 PASS / 2 FAIL —
`tests/unit/d1-readonly-query.test.mjs` and
`tests/unit/production-certify-workflow.test.mjs` hit the 5 s default timeout in
this sandbox (both PASS with `--testTimeout=60000`, ~6.2 s each; unrelated to
T20). Because the script stops at tests, `pnpm check:migrations`
(`migration-smoke=ok`) and `pnpm build` (`✓ built in 10.45s`) were run
separately: PASS. `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` PASS. The running-app
UI check was not performed (the T20 UI flag stays off here). Nothing merged,
deployed or migrated; production D1 not accessed; no T20 flags enabled.

Next: open a PR from this branch, confirm hosted `validate` is green (it should
no longer flake at the old line 177), then run a flag-enabled local visual check
of the picker cuisine select before any T20 release.

# T20 PR #7 — final merge-readiness handoff, 2026-09-26 UTC

No implementation changes remained after review of `6882ba3` against main
`136cb6f`. PR #7 was MERGEABLE/CLEAN, with no review comments; exact-head
hosted `validate` run `36217584128` SUCCESS. `git diff --check
origin/main...HEAD` PASS. `pnpm exec vitest run
tests/unit/composition-flags.test.mjs tests/integration/d1-schema-gate.test.ts
tests/unit/t20-composer-candidates.test.ts tests/unit/t20-meal-composition.test.ts`
PASS (4 files / 46 tests). Previously the application head `0b465d5` passed
`pnpm check` (typecheck, lint, 201 files / 4,549 tests, migration smoke, build);
subsequent commits changed docs only. Remote D1 not accessed; no migration,
deploy, flag enablement, merge or T19 authority change.

Next: check hosted CI on this docs-only handoff head, then hand the merge
decision to the user. The database operator applies 0039 before deployment;
the release owner opts into paired server/UI flags only after the target D1 is
migrated. Neither action blocks merging.

# Tako-san T20 PR #7 review remediation (4 × P1 + candidate-cap P2) - 2026-09-26 UTC

**Status: `T20_REVIEW_P1_REMEDIATED` — local `pnpm check` PASS (200 files /
4,541 tests); PR #7 hosted `validate` run `36210020774` SUCCESS on head
`424be56` (MERGEABLE, CLEAN; this docs-only commit gets its own run). Production untouched: no
deploy, no D1 migration, T19 authority unchanged (d1/0/cutover=true, 500).**

`branch=feat/t20-meal-composition-v2` (PR #7), review base head `febeb1f`; implementation commit `2e4f878`.

Fixed (review findings on PR #7; the earlier "P1 = 0" claim was wrong):
- P1 Manual hard safety: T03 `evaluateHardRestrictions` extracted from
  `evaluateRankingEligibility` (behaviour unchanged) is the single definition.
  New `packages/recipes/src/composition/restrictions.ts` judges every component a
  Manual mutation adds (add/swap/replace, and Assisted/Auto apply) on the same
  T02 candidate (slot inventory, planner substitution policy, server evidence
  provider) that Auto ranks: dietary/allergen unknown, time unknown/over, hard
  nutrition unknown/conflict, forbidden (incl. used substitutes), never-recommend
  → 422 `HARD_CONSTRAINT_CONFLICT`. Simple foods use the same function in Auto,
  Manual and picker (Auto previously ignored time/nutrition for simple foods).
  No manual override model.
- P1 V1 family meals: composition routes (Manual/Assist/Auto) return 422
  `LEGACY_FAMILY_COMPOSITION_UNSUPPORTED` up front; the UI keeps V1 "Swap meal"
  and shows no composer for family slots. Family slots are now projected
  (`legacy_family`, exact T04 variant identity), so composed-plan shopping no
  longer drops their demand (it silently did before); an unresolvable variant is
  409 `COMPOSITION_REVALIDATION_REQUIRED`.
- P1 shopping substitution authority: `EvaluationScope` requires
  `substitutions/approvedSubstitutionIds/activeConstraints`, built by
  `evaluationScope(context)` from the same planning context as the planner and
  Auto. (The production context still supplies empty lists — no reviewed registry.)
- P1 flags: `deploy.yml` input `meal_composition_v2_enabled` (default false) →
  `release-check.mjs gate` normalizes once (manifest `mealCompositionV2Enabled`)
  → Build `VITE_MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2_ENABLED` + Worker `--var
  MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2_ENABLED` in staging and production; `scripts/composition-flags.mjs
  verify` fails unless server/UI/manifest/compiled value (`dist/composition-flags.json`,
  written by a Vite build plugin outside `dist/client`) agree. Wrangler configs
  default `"false"`. Production build moved to its own step after local gates.
  UI falls back to V1 controls when the composition API 404s (mismatch).
- P2 candidate bias: all role-matching recipes are generated and ranked; the 320
  cap applies after ranking with a per-role quota (no catalog-order truncation).
- Preview: `PREVIEW_MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2_SERVER=false` drills the UI-on/server-off
  mismatch in the isolated preview.

Checks executed (local, Node 24.19):
- `pnpm check` PASS: typecheck (app + worker), lint, Vitest **200 files / 4,541
  tests** (612.9 s), `migration-smoke=ok`, build.
- New suites: `tests/unit/t20-composition-safety.test.ts` (13),
  `tests/integration/t20-legacy-family-and-safety.test.ts` (5),
  `tests/unit/composition-flags.test.mjs` (17), +4 UI cases in
  `tests/unit/t20-meal-composer-ui.test.tsx`. Verified to fail on the old code:
  all 5 integration cases and the 2 UI family/mismatch cases.
- Browser (isolated preview, synthetic data, agent-browser, 390×844): flags on →
  composer shown, V1 swap hidden, Manual add of rice persisted; UI on/server off →
  compositions 404, V1 "Đổi món" shown, no composer. Family slot not browser-tested
  (static preview catalog has no families; covered by jsdom + HTTP tests).
- `deploy.yml` not executed on GitHub Actions (only parsed and unit-tested).

Remaining debt (not blocking): picker still lists recipes with
`constraintState: unknown` when safety is requested (server rejects on save);
role heuristics (staple 0 / dessert 0 in catalog); per-component servings.

Next: operator merge decision on PR #7 (not merged by the agent). After merge,
production Deploy fails closed until 0039 is applied through *Production D1
migration* (`expected_pre_tip=0038_auth_onboarding_completion.sql`,
`migration=0039_meal_composition_v2.sql`); staging D1 needs 0039 before its flag
is enabled. Automatic staging deploys ship the flag off. Then dispatch Deploy with
`meal_composition_v2_enabled=true` (see `DEPLOYMENT.md`).

# Tako-san T20 Meal Composition V2 - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `T20_CODE_COMPLETE` — local gates PASS; PR #7 hosted CI `validate`
run `36197958265` SUCCESS on implementation head `0db541da8619fdf03f21bc4fb93d081fa335a0d5` (MERGEABLE,
CLEAN; this docs-only commit gets its own PR-head run). T19: `T19_COMPLETE_OPERATOR_ACCEPTED`. Production
untouched: recipe authority d1/0/cutover=true, 500 recipes; no T20 deploy; no
production D1 migration.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`

`starting_main=136cb6ff3d2921eac237c7b106b37ab5ee12a13f`
`branch=feat/t20-meal-composition-v2`

Implemented (ADR-031, `MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2.md`):
- T20A: additive migration `0039_meal_composition_v2.sql`
  (`generated_meal_plan_compositions`, `generated_meal_plan_components`,
  `recipe_role_assignments`; partial unique indexes for one dish per meal);
  domain model, closed role enum, deterministic role rules with provenance,
  nine bounded simple foods, flexible meal profiles, V1 read-time projection.
- T20B: server-authoritative Manual builder API (add/remove/swap/lock/role/
  reorder/replace) sharing the plan `revision` behind a batch fence; picker
  (summary DTOs, role/kind/text filters, stable offset cursor, ≤ 24/page).
- T20C/D: Assisted (complete / regenerate unlocked) and Auto (top ≤ 3) on one
  bounded, deterministic beam search; suggestions never write; apply recomputes
  and requires the same option ID; locks are domain-enforced.
- T20E: all components of all meals projected against one running T04
  inventory projection, then unchanged T05 aggregation (single subtraction).
- T20F: composed week cards, meal composer, picker bottom sheet/dialog,
  suggestion panels; vi/en; lock `aria-pressed`, one polite live region, focus
  restoration, Escape cancels without mutation.
- V1: unedited slots read as `main / legacy_v1`; V1 schemas unchanged; V1 swap
  on a composed slot is 409 `COMPOSITION_MANAGED_SLOT`; V1 regenerate keeps
  locked components; V1 shopping projects components. Flag off = pre-T20.
- Flags: `MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2_ENABLED` (server) and
  `VITE_MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2_ENABLED` (UI), both default off, independent of T19.
- Preview: `PREVIEW_MEAL_COMPOSITION_V2=true node scripts/security-preview.mjs`
  opts the isolated preview into V2 (default off keeps the T06B browser suite).

Role distribution on the 500-recipe D1 release (pinned test): main 362, side
87, soup 70, vegetable 37, simple_food 7, staple 0, dessert 0; unclassified 0,
invalid 0, duplicates 0, contradictions 0, review-required 0.

Checks executed (local, Node 24.19, sqlite3):
- `pnpm check` PASS: typecheck, lint, Vitest **197 files / 4,502 tests**
  (725.9 s), `migration-smoke=ok`, build. T20 suites: 6 files / 48 tests; T19
  authority suites (split 11, persistence 18, observability 19) PASS;
  d1-schema-gate 9 PASS.
- Earlier full run: 4,496/4,497 with one unrelated 5 s timeout in
  `production-certify-workflow.test.mjs` under parallel load; that file passed
  48/48 in isolation and in the final `pnpm check`.
- Browser (isolated preview, synthetic data, agent-browser): 375×812, 390×844,
  768×1024, 1280×900 — plan generation, V1 cards, composer, Auto options and
  accept, picker keyboard focus/Escape return, no horizontal overflow, no
  unnamed controls.

Not done / deferred: leftovers (T20B/T21), per-component servings, role review
tooling and AI-assisted offline role proposals, picker ingredient/cuisine
filters, whole-week Auto, price-aware scoring. `tests/fixtures/migration-sha256.json`
gets the 0039 hash only after the migration is applied (fixture policy).

Next: independent review of PR #7 (not merged by the agent); require exact-head
hosted `validate` on the final head.
Rollout (separately authorized): apply 0039 to staging then production D1 (the
schema gate fails closed on a 0038 ledger), then enable both flags. Do not change
T19 recipe authority.

# Historical T19 operator closure / T20 unlocked - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `T19_COMPLETE_OPERATOR_ACCEPTED`. T20: `UNLOCKED`.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`
`main_baseline=136cb6ff3d2921eac237c7b106b37ab5ee12a13f` (PR #6 merge)

T19 closure was accepted by the operator based on the successful final D1
deployment, the rollback proof, the final restoration, exact-main CI, the
existing production read-only certification and runtime release evidence.
The evidence below is operator-reported for runs on the same main SHA; this
agent did not re-run or re-read those production runs in this task.

- Exact-main CI `36149295615` SUCCESS; current-main staging `36149849086`
  SUCCESS.
- Production sequence: shadow `36150427552`, canary-1 `36151130515`,
  canary-5 `36152198646`, canary-25 `36153116467`, first d1 `36153948951`
  (all SUCCESS).
- Rollback proof `36154980456` SUCCESS (d1 → shadow): PASS.
- Final restore: canary-1 `36167843671`, canary-5 `36176092421`, canary-25
  `36176824421`, final d1 `36183890785` (all SUCCESS): PASS.
- Final production authority: `mode=d1`, `percent=0`, `cutover=true`,
  `source=d1`, served recipes `500`, release `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`,
  `fallback=null`, runtime fingerprint `f8cf8c7ff59df9fe29e246b9e3c9aad0fd155fa8df35bf671ac4d03fa2b5ab37`.

**The final post-rollout read-only recertification was waived by the
operator. No post-final-D1 certification run occurred; do not invent a PASS
receipt for it.**

T20 (Meal Composition V2) is unlocked and implemented on
`feat/t20-meal-composition-v2`; see the T20 section above this one once it is
recorded. T20 must not change production recipe authority (d1/0/true, 500).

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

- d1 promotion `36144837880` failed because post-deploy readiness identified
  the Worker by commit only; old and new versions share the commit. Automatic
  restore succeeded after one retry (receipt `rollback.result=restored`).
- Fix in `scripts/release-check.mjs` and `scripts/wait-for-deployed-release.mjs`
  plus regressions; no workflow, secret, migration or app change.
  `pnpm check` PASS (191 files / 4,453 tests).
- **Next action:** after merge, restart on the new SHA from `shadow` with
  `confirm_recipe_catalog_rollback=true` (required by the transition rules
  when leaving canary-25), then canary 1 → 5 → 25 → d1, rollback proof and
  final d1. Do not retry d1 on `a3e1614`: it can race again.

  full main SHA as `ref` and `hardened_sha`, `confirm_production=true`,
  bootstrap `confirm_recipe_catalog_rollback=true`); reviewer approves; agent
  inspects receipt; continue canary 1 → 5 → 25 → d1, rollback proof, final
  restoration to d1 on the same SHA. No main merges until complete; publish
  these docs afterwards.

# Historical T19 exact implementation patch handoff - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_WORKFLOW_WRITE_PERMISSION_BLOCKED`. Sent the tested
single-commit `399ec9b` implementation patch to the owner for an authorized
maintainer to apply. No remote branch, PR, production query or certification
result was created by this exchange. T19/T20 BLOCKED.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

- `git format-patch -1 399ec9b --stdout` and exact
  `git diff 399ec9b^ 399ec9b` show the same six implementation files. Do
  **not** use `git diff main...399ec9b` because local docs commits precede
  the implementation. No secrets or unrelated protected paths included.
- `git diff --check 399ec9b^ 399ec9b` PASS; `git apply --check -` of the
  format patch on an isolated archive of `origin/main=f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2` PASS.
  Repository remains on local branch with pre-existing untracked `.context/`;
  this handoff does not claim GitHub publication or remote certification.
- Next: authorized reviewer applies patch to fresh main, runs relevant tests,
  opens PR; after normal merge require exact-new-main CI, new-SHA staging
  receipt and a new production read-only certification with required review.
  Production rollout/migration and T20 still blocked.

# Historical T19 workflow publication permission handoff - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_WORKFLOW_WRITE_PERMISSION_BLOCKED`. Query-path repair
locally green, but not published: no PR, no new CI, no new staging receipt,
no production certification. T19 and T20 blocked.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

- Tested implementation `399ec9b`, docs `17ab64c` are local on
  `hoplite/stymphalos-a3bdf6c6`. Full `pnpm check` PASS: 191 test files /
  4,432 tests, lint, typecheck, migration smoke and build. `.context/`
  pre-existed untracked; `.hoplite/settings.json` was not modified.
- Push `git push origin HEAD:hoplite/stymphalos-a3bdf6c6` failed at remote:
  `refusing to allow a GitHub App to create or update workflow
  .github/workflows/deploy.yml without workflows permission`. Managed App is
  active for canonical repository ID `1385308553`; remote branch absent,
  PR list empty, main still `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`. Installation metadata GET was
  not readable (401 JWT required); this does not weaken explicit push refusal.
- **Next action:** use an approved integration with GitHub workflow-file write
  permission, or authorized maintainer publishing the **exact tested patch**, to
  create and review the PR. No token sharing or workflow-stripping workaround.
  After normal merge: exact-main CI → fresh staging receipt on new SHA →
  owner/reviewer-approved read-only production certification → inspect full
  PASS/unchanged baseline. No migration/rollout/T20 before those gates.
- Checks: `credential_control status`; denied explicit-ref `git push`;
  `git ls-remote` (branch absent); `gh pr list` (empty);
  `gh api repos/tako-vn1/Tako-san/commits/main` (`f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`).
  No production D1/Worker changes by this agent.

# Historical T19 production certification query repair handoff - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `T19_PRODUCTION_READ_ONLY_CERTIFICATION_BLOCKED`. Old-main staging
PASS; owner production certification run `36101940395` FAIL; no production
mutation by this change. T19 and T20 BLOCKED.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

- Run `36101940395` attempt 1 (`workflow_dispatch`, head `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`)
  passed its release gate, post-review exact-main gate, production identity,
  previous Worker baseline, and remote schema/0001–0038/foreign-key gate.
  Its first `wrangler d1 execute --file schema-gate.sql` exited 1 with no
  bounded diagnostic. The failure receipt lacks `certification.result=PASS`,
  verified 500-recipe D1 catalog, runtime, health and final ledger proof;
  production readiness remains unknown. No deploy/migration was initiated.
- Pinned Wrangler 3.114.17 routes remote `--file` to D1's import API (DB
  blocking, summary instead of rows); `--command` uses the query API. The
  precise exit-1 cause is not proven. The repair changes all three
  certification proofs (schema, two-statement catalog, five-statement
  runtime) to guarded per-SELECT `--command` calls and fixes the same issue
  in Deploy runtime preflight. Existing validation and Environment approval
  stay fail-closed; no dependency upgrade or production API token change.
- New `scripts/d1-readonly-query.mjs` is fingerprint-pinned in the certification
  safety test. New unit regressions cover real generated SQL, query arguments,
  response shape and mutation/partial-output rejection. Five focused test
  files (260 tests), lint, typecheck and diff-check PASS. Workspace sqlite3
  was missing; `.hoplite/setup.sh` was added and `sandbox_control setup`
  installed it, preserving tracked settings overlay. `pnpm check:migrations`
  subsequently passed (`migration-smoke=ok`). Full `pnpm check` PASS:
  lint, typecheck, **191 test files / 4,432 tests**, migration smoke, build.
  Implementation checkpoint: `399ec9b`; docs are separate.
- **Next:** review/merge workflow repair; require protected exact-new-main
  CI, fresh staging deploy/receipt on that new SHA, then independently run
  Production Read-Only Certification with approved hardening SHA and reviewer
  gate. Only a complete PASS and unchanged baseline permits planning the
  separately authorized production D1 migration and staged rollout; T20 is
  blocked. Rerunning old run `36101940395` cannot use a merged workflow.

Executed checks: `gh api` GET for run/jobs/artifact `36101940395`;
`gh run view --log-failed` bounded; local Wrangler source for both remote
paths; `git fetch origin --prune --quiet`, exact-main API and actor/event;
`pnpm wrangler --version`; focused Vitest 5 files / 260 tests PASS;
`pnpm lint` PASS; `pnpm typecheck` PASS; `git diff --check` PASS;
`pnpm check:migrations` originally failed due absent sqlite3, then
`sandbox_control setup` PASS; `pnpm check:migrations` PASS;
`pnpm check` PASS (lint, typecheck, 191 files / 4,432 tests, migration
smoke, build). No live production SQL or Worker operation by the agent.

# Historical T19 staging PASS / production read-only handoff - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_OWNER_TRANSFER_CONTROL_PLANE_MISMATCH`: installation
cannot dispatch production read-only certification (HTTP 403). Staging PASS;
production certification NOT STARTED; T19 and T20 BLOCKED. No production
mutation.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

- **Rerun:** Deploy `36018964086` attempt 2 is SKIPPED (release/staging/
  production all no steps); cause of historical event gate mismatch is not
  conclusively established. It made no deployment.
- **Current-main staging:** owner manually dispatched the reviewed Deploy
  workflow as `36092413084` attempt 1, event `workflow_dispatch`, head
  `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`, actor `tako-vn1`. Release SUCCESS, staging SUCCESS,
  production SKIPPED. Secret preflight, build, exact-main CI recheck, staging
  deploy, smoke and protected authority proof all SUCCESS. Artifact
  `release-staging-36092413084-1`: deployed SHA `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`, staging,
  `static/0/cutover=false`, actual/global `static`, 71 served, release
  `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`, fallback null. Hosted smoke log: readiness/database `ok`,
  smoke PASS. D1 readiness in static mode `not_evaluated` (not a production
  D1 proof). The accepted staging secret now works for this workflow; its
  actual value or IAM policy was not inspected.
- **Production gate:** main and green CI `36018278513` still match staged
  SHA. Production Environment requires `vn-taphoanhatung`. Reviewed
  `.github/workflows/production-certify.yml` is active and manual/main-only.
  Attempt to dispatch read-only certification with exact SHA and approved
  hardening SHA from staging artifact failed HTTP 403 (`Resource not accessible
  by integration`); no certification run, no production mutation. Do not
  replace with deploy or migration.
- **Next:** owner goes to **Actions → Production Read-Only Certification →
  Run workflow** on `main`, copies *full* `sha` and `hardenedSha` from
  `release-manifest.json` in the successful staging run's
  `release-staging-36092413084-1` artifact, sets
  `confirm_read_only_certification=true`. Require approval from existing
  production reviewer; then inspect certification result, unchanged
  production, catalog/ledger/integrity and rollback baseline. Only after a
  read-only PASS may a separately authorized D1 migration/rollout be
  considered; T20 remains blocked.
- **Executed checks:** `gh api` run/attempt/jobs/artifacts for old/new Deploy;
  download candidate and final staging artifacts into temporary directories;
  explicit safe receipt fields and bounded hosted smoke/authority log markers;
  `git fetch origin --prune --quiet`, main API and hosted CI;
  production Environment/workflow GETs; `gh workflow run
  .github/workflows/production-certify.yml` (403). No local application tests
  since no application/workflow code changed.

# Historical T19 staging rerun handoff - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_OWNER_TRANSFER_CONTROL_PLANE_MISMATCH` (Actions rerun
permission denied). Owner says staging secret updated; metadata cannot be
read. T19 and T20: `BLOCKED`. No deployment/production mutation in this retry.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

- **Owner report:** dedicated staging Cloudflare token and GitHub Environment
  update completed; installation cannot independently inspect the secret
  (`gh secret list --env staging` HTTP 403). Never ask for its value.
- **Exact main/CI:** `git fetch origin --prune --quiet`, repository/commit API
  and hosted CI confirm `main=f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`, repository ID `1385308553`, CI
  `36018278513` `validate` SUCCESS. Workflow file equals `origin/main`.
- **Reviewed retry blocked:** attempted full `gh run rerun 36018964086 -R
  tako-vn1/Tako-san`, which GitHub denied (`Resource not accessible by
  integration`). Original `workflow_run` attempt remains 1, release SUCCESS,
  staging FAILURE (Cloudflare 10000 preflight), production SKIPPED. No new
  run/deploy. Read-only OAuth cannot list staging Worker secrets either (`No
  access to the specified resource`). Do not use ad-hoc Wrangler deploy or
  move main to provoke CI.
- **Next action:** owner opens
  `https://github.com/tako-vn1/Tako-san/actions/runs/36018964086` and clicks
  **Re-run jobs → Re-run all jobs**. Full retry recreates attempt-specific
  release artifact; `--failed` alone is not appropriate. Inform this thread
  when triggered. Inspect exact attempt, staging jobs, smoke/authority proof
  before proceeding. This `workflow_run` cannot start production; production
  requires a separate manual dispatch and Environment approval. T20 blocked.
- **Executed checks:** `git fetch origin --prune --quiet`;
  `git diff origin/main -- .github/workflows/deploy.yml` (no diff); GitHub
  repository/main/CI/deploy GETs; `gh secret list -R tako-vn1/Tako-san --env
  staging` (403); `gh run rerun 36018964086 -R tako-vn1/Tako-san` (denied);
  Wrangler whoami/Worker-secret-list probe (read-only OAuth lacks access).
  No application tests (no code change).

# Historical T19 Cloudflare login handoff - 2026-09-25 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_STAGING_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN_REQUIRED`; T19 and T20:
`BLOCKED`. No Cloudflare token created, no GitHub secret changed, no staging
deployment or production mutation performed.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

- **Fresh permission recheck after owner authorization (2026-09-25 UTC):**
  rotated the GitHub App installation credential; staging Environment
  secret-name and Actions-policy GETs still return HTTP 403. Cloudflare
  `whoami` still lists only read-only user/account OAuth scopes; no staging
  API token exists in the workspace. Main is still `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`, last Deploy
  remains failed run `36018964086`. No secret write, token creation or workflow
  dispatch attempted. Need an approved integration with Cloudflare API Tokens
  Write and GitHub Environment Secrets write, **or** owner-side secure UI
  provisioning of the dedicated staging token/secret. Authorization in chat
  does not grant the missing service-issued permissions.
- **Authorized login:** owner approved Wrangler device login. Transient
  `pnpm dlx wrangler@4.119.0 login --device --browser=false --scopes user:read account:read`
  succeeded; sanitized `pnpm dlx wrangler@4.119.0 whoami` confirms Cloudflare
  account ID `ef250a88911fd24073cb73d1c07e0218`. Only `user:read`, `account:read` and
  `offline_access` OAuth scopes were granted. No token values were copied into
  GitHub, logs, docs or chat; do not use the OAuth snapshot as a CI secret.
- **Token creation blocker:** Cloudflare's API token-creation endpoint needs
  `API Tokens Write`, which Wrangler's device login does not offer. The managed
  GitHub App also cannot administer Environment secrets. GitHub CLI being a
  managed App does not mean the owner is not logged into GitHub in a browser;
  the older `TAKOSAN_GITHUB_LOGIN_REQUIRED` wording below is historical and
  overstates that distinction.
- **State:** GitHub commits API still reports `main=f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2` (`f933f22`);
  CI `36018278513` is green, Deploy `36018964086` is blocked on Cloudflare
  code `10000` before staging deployment. No staging Worker/D1 live identity
  proof from this read-only OAuth session; production remains untouched.
- **Exact checks:** `pnpm dlx wrangler@4.119.0 --version` and `login --help`;
  `login --scopes-list`; owner-approved device login; sanitized `whoami`;
  `gh api repos/tako-vn1/Tako-san/commits/main --jq .sha`; `gh auth status`;
  `git status --short --branch`; `git diff --check` and assertions for current
  T19 identities, blockers and historical records in all three docs. No local
  tests (no code changes).
- **Next owner action:** create a durable, dedicated staging API token in the
  Cloudflare dashboard with Worker-scripts write permission scoped to the
  correct account and set **only** GitHub `staging` Environment
  `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` in GitHub's UI. Never paste its value into chat or a
  repository file. Then confirm token and staging account/Worker/D1 identity,
  retry the reviewed exact-main staging Deploy, and require staging PASS before
  any gated production certification. No T20.

# Historical T19 owner-transfer handoff - 2026-09-24 UTC

**Status: `TAKOSAN_GITHUB_LOGIN_REQUIRED`; also
`TAKOSAN_STAGING_CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN_REQUIRED`. T19 and T20: `BLOCKED`.
No production mutation in this takeover.**

`canonical_repository=tako-vn1/Tako-san`
`canonical_repository_id=1385308553`

- **Transfer:** same numeric repository ID and preserved Git history as the
  historical `vn-tako4/Tako-san`; no mirror, migration, branch rewrite or remote
  URL change. `origin=https://github.com/tako-vn1/Tako-san.git`.
- **Main:** `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2` (`f933f22`) from `git fetch origin --prune`, the
  commits API and local HEAD. PR #1-#3 merge history and CI repository IDs
  still belong to repository `1385308553`.
- **Authentication:** managed CLI reports `x-access-token`, not a
  `tako-vn1` user account; `gh api user --jq .login` fails HTTP 403. Do not
  log out the brokered installation token. Owner-approved browser login is
  needed in an authorized CLI context; workflow scope for a user session is
  unverified.
- **Control plane:** `main` is protected with required Actions `validate`
  (App ID 15368); accessible rulesets/rules return `[]`. `staging` and
  `production` Environments exist. Production reviewer `vn-taphoanhatung`
  still has `write` permission. Installation authorization returns HTTP 403 for
  Actions policy, workflow token permissions, full protection, secret/variable
  names and webhooks, and HTTP 401 for app installation lookup; these controls
  need owner-side verification, not guesses about missing secrets.
- **Current-main CI:** run `36018278513` for `f933f222df992768534283b38d32b358498563d2`, event
  `push/main`, `validate` SUCCESS: ESLint/typecheck, 190 test files / 4,415
  tests, migration smoke, build. Hosted run and logs were inspected.
- **Staging:** last successful Deploy `36009510442` certified older SHA
  `d6204d91b1849bf98df89c1c590e74395c494c89`. Latest Deploy `36018964086` on current main: release
  SUCCESS, staging FAILURE, production SKIPPED. Wrangler secret-list preflight
  returns Cloudflare code `10000`; build/deploy/smoke skipped. Current main
  is **not** staging-certified. No local Cloudflare credentials/OAuth session;
  no token was created/replaced or Worker/D1 account verified.
- **Checks run:** `gh auth status`; `git remote -v`; `git fetch origin --prune`;
  `gh api user --jq .login` (403); repository/commit/branch/Environment/
  reviewer/rules/policy/secret-name GETs (restricted calls noted above);
  `gh run view 36018278513` / `36018964086` (jobs and failed logs);
  `gh run list --workflow Deploy`; local config/release manifest and Git
  status inspection. `git diff --check` and `python3` checks for current identity,
  blocked gate and historical preservation passed for all three docs. No local
  test/build run because no application code changed.
- **Next:** authorized `tako-vn1` CLI login and owner-side control-plane audit;
  obtain a durable least-privilege staging Cloudflare token, verify staging
  identity and replace only staging `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`; retry reviewed
  exact-main staging Deploy. Production read-only certification and approval
  come **after** staging PASS. No docs-only PR or main movement for this receipt.
  T20 remains blocked.

# Historical pre-transfer T19 release-control handoff - 2026-09-25

**Status: `TAKOSAN_STAGING_BLOCKED`. Exact-main CI: `GREEN`.
Production: `UNTOUCHED`.
T20: `BLOCKED`.**

- **Canonical identity:** `vn-tako4/Tako-san` (ID `1385308553`); docs-recovery
  merge baseline `a86ed095ba77d1e3e1ba549ee5b28240d50ba731`.
- **PR #1:** merged normally at `2026-09-24T13:55:01Z`; reviewed head
  `0899c49a28906d09f1a51b8afe2c72e09c860f18`; merge commit `d6204d91`.
- **PR CI:** run `36007943241`, exact head `0899c49a`, `validate` SUCCESS.
- **Exact-main CI:** run `36009002161`, event `push`, branch `main`, exact SHA
  `d6204d91`, `validate` SUCCESS. Lint, typecheck, 190 files / 4,415 tests,
  migration smoke and build passed.
- **Diagnosis:** the reported zero-run state was observed in the four-second
  interval between merge and run creation. Human actor `vn-tako4`, active and
  unchanged CI YAML, matching `push/main` filter, no skip directive and enabled
  Actions policy rule out recursion suppression and control-plane failure.
- **Automatic staging:** Deploy run `36009510442` was created by the successful
  main CI. Release and staging succeeded; production was skipped. The receipt
  records exact SHA `d6204d91`, `static`, canary `0`, cutover `false`, source
  `static`, 71 served recipes and null fallback.
- **Docs recovery:** PR #2 merged docs-only head `2002dfd2` as `a86ed095`.
  Exact-main CI run `36016668591` passed `validate`; automatic Deploy
  `36017207468` ran release successfully and skipped production.
- **Current staging blocker:** staging stopped before build/deploy because the
  stored GitHub `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` was rejected by Cloudflare with code
  `10000`. Secret names remain present. Local Wrangler OAuth can refresh and read
  the Worker secret list, proving the stored access-token snapshot expired or was
  invalidated. Staging remains on healthy SHA `d6204d91`; `a86ed095` was not
  deployed.
- **Safety:** Production certification was not run. Production deploy, D1,
  secrets, traffic and rollback remain untouched. T20 remains blocked.
- **Residuals:** dependency audit and the separate `usehoplite` zero-check-run
  behavior remain follow-ups; protected `validate` is green and unaffected.
- **Next:** provision a durable least-privilege Cloudflare token, replace only the
  staging Environment credential, then repeat the reviewed staging path. Handle
  production prerequisites/certification separately. Do not start rollout or T20
  automatically.

# Historical T19 production read-only certification workflow - 2026-09-23

**Status: `T19_V2_PRODUCTION_CERT_WORKFLOW_PR_PENDING`. Production: `UNTOUCHED`.**

- **Base/branch:** `vn-tako4/Frigo-dev` (ID `1368281478`), main `a4b5d726`,
  exact-main CI `35817133131` PASS; branch `hoplite/akanthos-df8cfb50`.
- **Staging:** Deploy `35817440484` attempt 2 SUCCESS, production SKIPPED.
  Exact-main SHA, static/0/no-cutover, static source, 71 served recipes,
  `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`, null fallback; machine receipt independently checked.
- **Changes:** manual `production-certify.yml` plus focused workflow tests.
  Existing release and D1 algorithms are reused unchanged. Production Environment
  approval remains mandatory. Read-only SQL/metadata only; no mutation command.
  Only sanitized manifest artifacts; no secret access for authority proof.
- **Checks:** focused 236/236, lint, typecheck, local config, migration smoke,
  build and diff check PASS. Missing sqlite3 initially blocked migration smoke;
  the existing repository setup repaired it. `pnpm test` exceeded the local
  600-second command budget (exit 124); no full-suite pass is claimed. Hosted
  complete-suite CI remains required; all eight workflow blocks pass `bash -n`.
  Exact commands and structural-vs-IAM safety limits: `CURRENT_STATE.md`.
- **Publication:** implementation commit `aee4e2e` is local only. Push of
  `HEAD:hoplite/akanthos-df8cfb50` failed: this GitHub App lacks `workflows`
  permission for the new workflow file. PR creation then failed because the
  remote head branch does not exist. No PR/new hosted CI; do not claim publication.
- **Next:** operator authorizes Workflows write for the existing repository App
  installation, then retry the explicit branch push and narrow PR (never bypass
  permissions). Require exact-head CI/review and maintainer merge, new main CI, then
  dispatch Production Read-Only Certification on main with `ref=<full new main>`,
  `hardened_sha=<owner-approved exact SHA>`,
  `confirm_read_only_certification=true`. Wait for production Environment approval.
  Inspect `certification.result=PASS` and the full sanitized receipt; a candidate
  or partial failure artifact does not certify production. Missing ledger entries
  must HOLD, never migrate in this workflow. Secret pair remains a separate gate.
- **Boundary:** agent merge is prohibited; no live certification has run. No
  deployment, migration, secret/config change or traffic mutation. T20 NOT STARTED.

# Release-secret provisioning receipt - 2026-09-23

**Status: `T19_V2_RELEASE_SECRET_PROVISIONING_BLOCKED`. Production: `UNTOUCHED`.**
Main `c0c8e82ac9bdb3167de4e5774c90cbd364b5ff92` (exact-main CI `35815588844` PASS) is
the release candidate. Automatic staging run `35815905652` failed BEFORE
deployment: the staging job env proves GitHub effective
`STAGING_RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN` is MISSING (empty), Cloudflare secrets PRESENT
(masked), staging Worker `RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN` UNKNOWN. This installation can
neither read secret metadata (HTTP 403) nor write GitHub/Worker secrets, and has
no Cloudflare credential.

**Next (operator):** provision the staging pair with one shared >= 32-byte random
value (GitHub staging `STAGING_RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN` = `frigo-staging` Worker
`RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN`; separate from the future production value), then re-run
the reviewed staging workflow for the current exact main. Certify staging
(deployed SHA, mode, canary percent, cutover, release ID, recipe count,
fingerprint, D1 readiness, fallbackReason, protected authority proof, smoke)
before any production read-only certification. No ad-hoc `wrangler deploy`.
Details in `docs/ai/CURRENT_STATE.md`; the rest of this file remains the
historical trail.

# Current takeover receipt - 2026-09-23

**Status: `T19_V2_CODE_COMPLETE_PRODUCTION_BLOCKED`. Production: `UNTOUCHED`.**
Repository ID `1368281478` is `vn-tako4/Frigo-dev`. Application PR #53 merged
normally at `03005fcbc39ab3c964393d2091f726088a4be5d0`; exact-head PR CI
`35810551334` and exact-main CI `35810986000` both PASS (189 files / 4,367 tests).
Integration reviewed head is `dbf32547a07fbc767e044365866a2bdfc4264cd8`; the
original recovery branch remains immutable at `0a04209e512d19293ed56a19d3fd51eb29ffefcd`.

Rechecked after the external merge: main remains `03005fc` and preserves the
exact recovered checkpoint. PR #54 carries this documentation-only handoff;
the application must not be reconstructed or republished as another PR.
Production D1 certification is blocked: this workspace has no Cloudflare API
token and `pnpm wrangler whoami` reports unauthenticated. Earlier takeover
evidence recorded missing GitHub verification secrets. Current repository and
Environment secret/variable listings return HTTP 403, so their present contents
cannot be independently verified here; Worker-side presence remains unverified.
Automatic staging run `35811338820` failed BEFORE deployment on the missing
staging verification secret; its production job was skipped. No deployment,
migration, secret change, rollout or rollback was performed.

See `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T19_V2_TAKEOVER_AUDIT.md` for evidence and operator
steps. Provision the release prerequisites, certify production read-only, then
use the reviewed rollout workflow and prove rollback. T19 is NOT complete;
T20 remains blocked. Earlier pending/publication-blocked claims below are
historical and superseded by this receipt.

# Frigo / Takosan current handoff — 2026-09-22

## T19 V2 — recipe authority cutover (integration)

- **Base/branches:** repository ID `1368281478` (`vn-tako3/Frigo-dev`); exact
  canonical main/integration base `a3b1564`; immutable original branch
  `feat/t19-recipe-authority-cutover-v2` at `0a04209`; active branch
  `feat/t19-recipe-authority-cutover-v2-integration`.
- **State:** `T19_V2_APPLICATION_INTEGRATED_CI_PENDING`. Application authority unification
  (Recipe API = Planner = Shopping = Cooking under one `resolveRecipeAuthority`),
  authority-scoped fingerprints, stored-plan authority identity with typed
  revalidation, reviewed full-D1 release states (`static|shadow|canary{1,2,5,25}|d1`,
  derived cutover), protected recipe-authority release evidence.
- **Publication truth:** the original branch remains published and unchanged
  at `0a04209`. Application checkpoint `558be74` is integrated from current
  main (branch commits `8205883` + `553791a` + docs); PR #52 is merged
  historical documentation. **Safe stop 2026-09-23: the integration branch is
  publication-blocked** — the GitHub App credential cannot push
  workflow-changing commits (exact error in the canonical handoff). Recovery
  artifacts are workspace-only: `.artifacts/t19-current-safe-stop.bundle` and
  `.artifacts/t19-current-safe-stop.patch`, with SHA-256 values in
  `.artifacts/t19-current-safe-stop.sha256`. Hosted application CI has not run.
  Production is untouched.
- **Verification (current tree):** full Vitest 189 files / 4,364 tests PASS
  (run A); the final rerun (run B) passed 4,363 with one 5 s contention
  timeout in the unrelated T13 real-D1 file, which passed 22/22 in isolation;
  focused 13-file matrix 356 PASS plus 23 snapshot/persistence tests after the
  last cleanup; release-check 155, D1 certification 32, Worker rollback 10 PASS;
  `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck` (both), `pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build`,
  `pnpm recipe:import:check` (`rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`, 500 recipes) and `git
  diff --check` PASS. The Wrangler-shaped `release-certify` fixture proves tip
  0037, 500 recipes, clean foreign keys and `quick_check=ok`.
- **Final hardening:** planner content/steps always come from the authority
  snapshot (static reads no D1 rows; d1 enrichment is fenced and degradable);
  same-source authority drift is typed; shadow and canary release probes
  exercise D1 so shadow cannot promote on `not_evaluated`; Deploy certifies
  `wrangler.jsonc` binding, Cloudflare/D1 identity, ledger, catalog identity
  (ordered IDs, duplicates, `runtime_order`), `foreign_key_check`,
  `quick_check` read-only before mutation; release ref must equal current
  main; backwards SHAs, stale/skipped/reverse promotions and unconfirmed
  downgrades/bootstraps fail; previous and deployed Worker versions must bind
  the pinned D1; failure or cancellation restores the exact previous version via
  the Cloudflare API with a complete evidence proof; staging is fail-closed on
  its proof configuration.
- **Blocked on (in order):** publication with a workflows-capable credential
  (owner action) → application PR + exact-head hosted CI/review → normal merge
  + exact-main CI → verified production identity, release secrets
  (`RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN` production + staging Worker secrets,
  `STAGING_RELEASE_VERIFY_TOKEN`) and `production` Environment approval.
- **Next:** the owner (or a `workflows`-granted installation) pushes
  `git push origin HEAD:feat/t19-recipe-authority-cutover-v2-integration`,
  verifies the remote SHA equals local HEAD, then the application PR opens. No
  production action before merge and exact-main certification. T20 stays
  blocked. Rollback after rollout = reviewed redeploy to `shadow` (or `static`
  if policy requires it), never data deletion.
- **Canonical handoff:**
  [T19_V2_WIP_HANDOFF.md](recipe-catalog/T19_V2_WIP_HANDOFF.md).

## Google Safari profile recovery + registration-only Turnstile

- **Base/branch:** repository `vn-tako1/Frigo-dev`; exact canonical base
  `8dc9198918837cb15f4a7ddf4f9029875b015091`; isolated branch
  `codex/google-safari-turnstile`.
- **Root cause:** the PWA service worker intercepted cross-origin GIS loads.
  After a blocker rejected the first load, its default cache fallback resolved
  no response and left the normal WebKit profile stuck; a clean/private profile
  worked. Clearing service-worker/cache state recovered immediately.
- **Fix:** `public/sw.js` bypasses every cross-origin request before
  `respondWith`; Google GIS and Turnstile therefore use the browser network
  stack. Same-origin uncached failure no longer resolves null.
- **Turnstile scope:** only `/auth/register` renders and verifies Turnstile.
  Login, forgot-password and resend do not challenge again. Auth rate limiting,
  resend cooldown, CSRF, OTP digest/single-use/expiry, and production config
  fail-closed behavior remain. Unknown/verified register/login resend addresses
  receive a generic no-op response and no email/OTP.
- **Evidence:** focused 124/124; full Vitest 185 files / 4242 tests; lint,
  typecheck, migration smoke, build and diff check pass. Candidate WebKit smoke
  with active service worker + first GIS request blocked recovered through the
  retry button; Google iframe 362x44, warning absent, login CAPTCHA frames 0,
  registration CAPTCHA frames 1.
- **Known unrelated baseline:** `pnpm audit --prod` reports two moderate React
  Router 6 advisories; no dependency changed.
- **Next:** publish PR, require exact-head hosted `validate`, merge only when
  green, then verify production release SHA/service worker and repeat WebKit
  smoke. See [GOOGLE_SAFARI_TURNSTILE_RECOVERY.md](GOOGLE_SAFARI_TURNSTILE_RECOVERY.md).

## T18E — `T18E_OTP_TEST_RECIPIENT_REQUIRED`

- **Base/branch:** repository `1368281478` / `vn-tako1/Frigo-dev`; exact base
  and production `66627ffea890dad1cec4e31674449775a940c660`; branch
  `feat/t18e-otp-email-delivery-recovery`.
- **Observed production state:** `SEND_EMAIL` and the operator-authorized
  `RESEND_API_KEY` secret are present; the supplied key authenticates. The
  operator completed DNS correction and Resend reports `tungjpstore.net`, DKIM,
  and both SPF-purpose records as verified. Current Cloudflare sender onboarding
  and the exact primary-provider rejection category remain UNKNOWN. Do not claim
  sender or recipient rejection without a sanitized event.
- **Implementation:** Workers Email -> Resend -> fail-closed is preserved;
  Resend HTTP/body categories are sanitized; final provider failures log only
  event/provider/category/purpose/environment; unexpected router rejection
  still invalidates production OTP; readiness separates configuration presence
  from delivery verification.
- **Contracts:** registration success/failure, fallback success, secured resend
  after initial failure, forgot-password anti-enumeration, single-use/replay,
  expiry, cooldown, Turnstile, digest-only storage and production `devOtp`
  suppression are certified. Client UX already remained truthful; no AuthPage
  or Google source changed.
- **Verification:** focused 165/165; full Vitest 185 files / 4238 tests; lint,
  typecheck, migration smoke and build PASS. Audit reports the unchanged
  lockfile baseline of 21 advisories / 6 high; no dependency changed.
- **PR/CI:** review-only [PR #50](https://github.com/vn-tako1/Frigo-dev/pull/50)
  is OPEN. Hosted validate run `35685553412` passed on publication head
  `eec404a`; PR was `MERGEABLE` / `CLEAN`. Wait for fresh exact-head CI after
  the final documentation receipt. Do not merge.
- **Safety:** no migration, workflow, payment, Google, D1, deploy, merge, or
  random test email. The only production mutation was the explicitly authorized
  Resend secret upload. Real inbox delivery is NOT RUN.
- **Next:** verify `no-reply@tungjpstore.net` in Cloudflare Email Service and
  supply an authorized test recipient. Then review/merge,
  exact-main CI, automatic staging and controlled staging delivery; production
  deploy remains separately authorized. See
  [T18E_OTP_DELIVERY_RECOVERY.md](T18E_OTP_DELIVERY_RECOVERY.md).

## T18D — `T18D_READY_FOR_REVIEW`

- **Task/base:** Human-style semantic hardening, not redesign; repository ID
  `1368281478`, `vn-tako1/Frigo-dev`, exact base `07ace57241f8270b2458610979c709bb69b9a65a` verified.
  Branch `feat/t18d-a11y-human-style-hardening` was created and pushed;
  implementation freeze is `d3ef61c`.
- **Scope/result:** The four original findings and seven additional scoped P2s
  are fixed. Independent review open P0/P1/P2 = **0/0/0**; two P3
  observations are deliberately deferred. The 27-screen disposition is
  **14 PASS / 13 PASS_WITH_NOTE / 0 FAIL**.
- **Evidence:** Final focused browser evidence is **14/14 PASS** in **42.8s**,
  strict axe clean; `.hoplite/artifacts/t18d/final/focused.log`. Final
  `lint`, `typecheck`, `test`, `check:migrations`, and `build` logs pass;
  Vitest is **185 files / 4226 tests** in **333.25s** under
  `.hoplite/artifacts/t18d/final/{lint,typecheck,test,check-migrations,build}.log`.
  Fresh style residuals **39 allowlisted / 0 unjustified** and contrast
  **33/33 PASS** were rerun under `final/`; lint/typecheck pass again after
  the test-only settling correction. `git diff --check` PASS.
- **Matrix recovery:** The second full matrix stopped at approximately case
  158 when `t17-a11y.e2e.ts` sampled scan-review entrance opacity and receipt
  enable-state before settle; failure context is retained. The parent patched
  the test to wait 350ms **after** async CTAs become enabled, matching T18C's
  settled-state convention. No axe rules or design tokens changed.
- **Final matrix:** **349 PASS / 5 intentional skips / 0 FAIL**, 354 total in
  23.3m, exit 0, no retries/flakes. All 84 T18D cases pass. The five skips are
  duplicate project instances of the once-passing mobile-390 breakpoint sweep.
  Strict axe violations **0** across 162 canonical checks; 45 incomplete
  contrast rule records retained. Exact command and suite counts in the report.
  Log:
  `.hoplite/artifacts/t18d/final/matrix-settled.log`, artifacts
  `.hoplite/artifacts/t18d/final/matrix-settled/`.
- **Boundaries/limitations:** No business/server/schema/workflow change, remote
  write, merge, or deployment. Human-style semantic, keyboard, and
  accessibility-tree/ARIA review were performed; VoiceOver/NVDA actual
  execution was not performed. Existing settings-file modification remains
  preserved and excluded.
- **Publication:** [PR #49](https://github.com/vn-tako1/Frigo-dev/pull/49) OPEN
  to `main`, review-only; verified checkpoint `fe1b5d4` matched remote (6 ahead /
  0 behind main, 0/0 vs upstream). Initial hosted `validate` IN_PROGRESS in run
  `35677663372` at 01:57 UTC; no unresolved review threads then. Auto-fix loop
  enabled, auto-merge disabled. This receipt is a subsequent doc-only checkpoint.
- **Next:** Inspect settled hosted CI and review feedback via the enabled loop.
  Do not merge, deploy, run remote migrations, or begin production promotion.

### T18D failure history — 2026-09-22

An earlier full gate pass recorded **185 files / 4226 Vitest PASS** in
331.37s. During AX-tree inspection, the completed timer still offered an
active pause control; this seventh P2 was fixed at the UI boundary with
`aria-disabled` focus retention, an inert terminal toggle, and working Reset,
without changing duration/store/ticks. An earlier 354-case matrix stopped at
case 96, and an earlier 13/14 focused attempt sampled an existing entrance
fade; neither is final evidence. The current final gates are recorded as
185 files / 4226 tests in 333.25s, and the settled matrix status and artifacts
are documented in the current T18D section above.

## T18C final handoff — `T18C_READY_FOR_REVIEW`

- **Task:** Continue existing T18C, not a restart. Repository ID `1368281478`
  is `vn-tako/Frigo-dev`; branch `feat/t18c-final-redesign-certification`,
  correct matching upstream, unchanged main/base `b8447e85`. Verified
  implementation freeze: `6f8f6f40bb2c47dacd33670ac7397b0528b469a8`.
- **Changes:** Evidence-led semantic, keyboard/focus, target, responsive and
  source-composition corrections only. Latest Home fix wraps rem-based regions
  under 200% text zoom without changing normal primary dominance. All 27
  identities compared to supplied boards/contracts at all six widths; final
  dispositions **2 PASS / 25 PASS_WITH_DOCUMENTED_DIFFERENCE**. No unresolved
  P0/P1/P2. Detailed differences are explicit in `T18C_VISUAL_CERTIFICATION.md`.
- **Checks:** `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, full `pnpm test` (**184 files /
  4222 PASS**, 554.62s), `pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build`,
  `node scripts/t17/style-residuals.mjs` (**39/0**),
  `node scripts/t17/contrast-audit.mjs` (**33/33**), `git diff --check` and
  `git diff --check origin/main...HEAD` PASS. Final gates ended 08:23:33 UTC.
  Six-project T17/T18C browser suite: **379 PASS / 11 intentional skips / 390
  unique cases**, zero strict axe violations or horizontal overflow across
  162 canonical captures. Exact shard/recovery commands: `final/reports/commands.md`.
- **Failures/recovery:** Pre-fix 378/11/1 run found genuine Home zoom P2;
  original assertion preserved and focused follow-up 12/12 PASS. Concurrent
  Vitest hit unchanged CLI timeout under browser contention, was interrupted,
  and then passed serially. Three 40-minute outer wrappers left five unfinished
  browser cases; exact recovery 4/4 + 1/1 PASS and manifest reconciliation prove
  zero missing/duplicate cases. Do not call it one uninterrupted green run.
- **Evidence:** Separate final matrix, raw shards/recovery, 449 regression
  screenshot files, Board 1/2/3 six-width reviews, gate logs, and preserved
  failed-run archives indexed in `.hoplite/artifacts/t18c/EVIDENCE.md`.
  Original baseline and approved-source hashes are unchanged.
- **Boundaries/database:** No backend/shared/packages/migration/workflow/Wrangler
  change. T18A auth, T18B 49000/499000 VND and issued-intent/webhook/entitlement
  authority, Inventory Truth, OCR/AI, planner and Week logic unchanged.
  Synthetic local SQLite fixtures only; no remote D1 change or real payment.
- **Limitations:** Human VoiceOver and NVDA **NOT PERFORMED**; incomplete axe
  records retained. Hardware/provider/production certification is not claimed.
- **Publication:** Certification/evidence checkpoint `321824d` pushed and
  verified. [PR #48](https://github.com/vn-tako/Frigo-dev/pull/48) OPEN to
  `main`; CI/review auto-fix **enabled**, auto-merge **disabled**. Hosted
  `validate` **SUCCESS** on `289d80a` (run `35578662531`, 08:40:02 UTC),
  including lint/typecheck/full Vitest/migration smoke/build. Final read:
  no reviews/comments/unresolved threads, `MERGEABLE` / `CLEAN`.
- **Final readiness audit:** No introduced migration/configuration follow-up
  or additional application fix. Protected-surface and application-freeze diff
  checks PASS; high-confidence credential/private-key scan of 443 changed-text
  files/archive members found no matches. Re-executed style audit **39/0**,
  contrast **33/33**, and both diff checks PASS. Independent configuration
  review agrees. No application/test changes; this receipt is docs only.
- **Next:** Confirm the latest documentation-head CI, then await owner merge
  permission. The enabled loop handles any new CI/review feedback. No merge,
  deploy, T18D or speculative redesign. Keep pre-existing
  `.hoplite/settings.json` and `.hoplite/extracted/` uncommitted.

## Historical continuation checkpoints (superseded)

### Final browser failure / text-zoom correction

- Complete run: **378 PASS / 11 intentional skips / 1 FAIL**. Home at 1024px
  overflowed by 46px under 200% text zoom; this is a real P2, not a fixture issue.
- Three Home layout classes now wrap by rem-based region width rather than
  forcing two columns at a pixel breakpoint. Original zoom assertion unchanged;
  new explicit stacked-region check added. Six-width focused follow-up:
  **12/12 PASS** in 1.8 minutes.
- Preserve the complete failed run separately as `pre-zoom/`; current board
  reviews cover that freeze and must not silently certify new Home pixels.
- Next: rerun all 390 cases in three isolated two-project groups (independent
  frontend/API ports and process-local in-memory SQLite, one worker per group),
  rerun complete repository gates, inspect regenerated images and archive.
  This changes scheduling only, not tests, fixtures, retries, or assertions.

### Complete repository gate receipt

- Application freeze `b024b0d41d13e07df253dad4f6a7d472ec1d7c11`.
- Fresh full `pnpm test`: **184 files / 4222 PASS**, 818.46s, finished
  2026-09-21T06:49:59Z. Lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build/diff-check PASS.
- Style **39 allowlisted / 0 unjustified**; contrast **33/33 PASS** (one
  informational border pair). Full-diff review found imported license trailing
  whitespace: normalized that line and its fetch script, without changing any
  font byte/checksum. Script ESLint and `node --check` PASS; 5/5 font hashes PASS.
- Evidence checkpoint: `.hoplite/artifacts/t18c/repository-gates.zip`.
  Browser/visual final certification remains running; no final browser total
  or PR claimed yet. Next: finish six-width run, archive matrix, finalize PR.

### Keyboard closure checkpoint

- Strict target gate identified new brand/title elements without explicit
  44px bounds. Existing `tap-target` utility now supplies them; gate unchanged.
  Focused mobile-360 a11y/gaps/flag-off run **14 PASS / 1 intentional skip**.
  Preserve failed attempt at `resume/target-bounds-final-attempt`; final run
  restarts on the explicit-bound implementation, not on `ef5a619`.

- Review follow-up found P2 no-op title buttons on non-recipe legacy Week
  slots. Removed those title actions/affordances; preserved real choose/change
  buttons. Two targeted red cases, then five units PASS and real routed
  flag-off setup 1/1 PASS. Independent re-review reports no P0/P1/P2.
- The 384-case run and concurrent repository gate were intentionally
  interrupted for this fix, not counted as final; archived at
  `resume/pre-review-final-attempt`. Restart full gates plus 390 browser cases.

- Native inventory/recipe navigation, item-named shopping checkbox state, shell
  brand links, and legacy Week card/setup controls preserve existing handlers.
- Focused browser red 2/2, green 12/12; sibling-action follow-up 1/1 after a
  test-only fix for row ordering after refetch. New real-Link rendering exposed
  an incomplete router mock (25 failures); MemoryRouter restored it without
  removing assertions. Final focused units 3 files / 37 PASS; typecheck,
  targeted ESLint and diff-check PASS. The new test's two type errors were
  corrected in its fixture (`appendChild`, lowercase `dinner`).
- Full gates and unfiltered 384-case browser run now in progress. Neither the
  earlier interrupted final attempts nor historical 4217 results are current
  proof. Logs remain under `resume/reports/interrupted-final` and
  `resume/reports/keyboard`; final evidence is separately under `final/`.
- Next: finish final gates, inspect fresh matrix, archive and publish review PR.

### Source-led fixes ready for final rerun

- Source/fixed-tree checkpoint pushed: `147f1714a8c8c81e2e0d37785a614c0e4446f2be`.
- All 27 boards/contracts directly compared; presentation corrections applied
  without changing protected business authority. Targeted browser gates:
  43 passed/5 intentional skips, 18 passed, boundary 1 passed; typecheck passed.
- Failure ledger: initial gap diagnostic was 7 failed/1 skipped/6 passed.
  RecipeCard was patched between its mobile red and desktop green cases, so
  this is not a single pre-fix snapshot. The first 306-case pre-fix T17 run
  was intentionally interrupted after 59 passes/1 planned screenshot skip
  to apply verified source-led fixes; it is not final proof. Its interrupted
  JSON is not a valid completion report. A supplemental boundary test then
  hit the real authenticated landing redirect; clearing public-session state
  corrected the fixture, and the unchanged layout assertions passed.
- Next: freeze implementation, run complete T18C/T17 and fresh native gates,
  inspect final screenshots, archive evidence, finish docs and review-only PR.
  Human VoiceOver/NVDA remain NOT PERFORMED.

## T18C safe pause — certification handoff (2026-09-21)

- **Task/status:** `T18C_PAUSED_SAFE`; overall `T18C_PARTIAL` with
  `DIRECT_BOARD_COMPARISON_PENDING`. No direct Takosan boards available.
- **Branch/base:** `feat/t18c-final-redesign-certification` from exact main
  `b8447e85f099b800a9a8ebc6c4c137adc9e45a32` in repository `1368281478` /
  `omin-jp/Frigo-dev`. Initial tree clean; main CI #145 and staging Deploy #52
  successful; production skipped; no overlapping redesign PR.
- **Changes:** Checkpoint A `ac4d90e` (harness, registry/report, 162-PNG
  baseline archive) pushed; evidence-led presentation fixes applied after it
  (landmarks, heading order ×11, camera reduced-motion, VietQR focus
  trap/return) with red/green targeted regressions and OFL font fixtures.
- **Checks:** typecheck PASS and one targeted payment-focus regression PASS on
  the paused tree; `git diff --check` PASS. Full Vitest 183/4217 applies only
  to the `ac4d90e`-era tree. Matrix/gate rerun NOT yet run.
- **Evidence:** durable baseline in `.hoplite/artifacts/t18c/baseline.zip`;
  remaining screenshots/logs are ephemeral (paths listed in the handoff).
- **Boundaries:** No backend/schema/workflow changes, no payment/OTP authority
  change, no real payment, remote D1, merge, staging or production deployment.
  No T18D work.
- **Next:** Owner-resumable plan and exact artifact/test ledger:
  [T18C_WIP_HANDOFF.md](T18C_WIP_HANDOFF.md). See also
  `T18C_VISUAL_CERTIFICATION.md`.

## T18B handoff — `T18B_READY_FOR_REVIEW` (2026-09-21)

- **Final review fix:** verified expected start `0926222` on the existing
  branch/PR; replaced current-price revalidation with strict issued-row
  validation. Monthly/annual price-change, old-order payment, new-order price,
  malformed-row, expiry, terminal-state and replay/grant tests pass: focused
  **151/151**, including **65** server payment; full `pnpm test` **183 files /
  4217 PASS**; six-width browser **48/48**; lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build/
  diff checks PASS. SQLite fixture and local HMR-origin recovery are documented
  in the report. Earlier counts below are historical. Verify new exact-head CI
  on PR #47 before owner review; no merge/deploy/payment authorization.
- **Identity/base:** `1368281478`, `omin-jp/Frigo-dev`; exact main/base
  `13ff3f22082fc0601a81b90c96edded4741194ac`; branch
  `feat/t18b-payment-authority`.
- **Publication:** [PR #47](https://github.com/omin-jp/Frigo-dev/pull/47), OPEN;
  CI/review auto-fix enabled, auto-merge disabled. Do not merge or deploy.
- **Durable checkpoints:** A `2aba91acceeefba74ea242c7a55cae3b7b6d1e40`, B
  `c00ea9fa132455f96aea31608b689ac87709d511`, C
  `1cef30b902435ee71b0fae60a92b36ed9c3ca268`, style fix
  `1aabd32562edc2c5c37b3db9d7d19e1938896084`; each pushed immediately.
- **Implemented:** Worker-owned 49000/499000 VND; strict plan-only intents;
  signed PayOS response and webhook verification; server-generated QR
  instructions; owned status reads; atomic once-per-order entitlement; fresh
  same-owner `/me`; stale request/session fences and honest unavailable states.
- **Authority lifecycle:** price table → new offers only; issued intent →
  immutable per-order plan/amount/currency/order/expiry with persisted lifecycle
  status; signed callback → match that persisted order, not current prices;
  entitlement → atomic grant only from a valid persisted paid intent.
- **Compatibility:** no schema change. Old activation cannot grant; `grantCode`
  returns 410. Server-only PayOS client/API/checksum credentials and APP_URL are
  required for checkout. Unknown/failed provider creation produces no instructions;
  late paid callbacks for failed orders require operator reconciliation/refund.
- **Verification:** focused payment/session/entitlement 121/121; browser 48/48
  across six widths plus error-state rerun 4/4; brand/checkout follow-up 38/38;
  full Vitest **183 files / 4185 tests PASS** using
  `pnpm test --maxWorkers=2 --minWorkers=2` (no exclusions). Lint/typecheck/
  migration smoke/build/diff check PASS. Independent final security review has
  zero remaining P0/P1/P2/P3 findings.
- **Failures/recovery:** first full suite 4184 pass/1 failure exposed raw error
  colors; fixed semantic tokens without weakening coverage. Earlier focused
  parallel cold-load timeout/state fallout passed with the same tests/two workers;
  Worker-vs-DOM import fixed through the existing test bridge; transient edited-file
  typecheck and generated SW build errors recovered and final gates passed.
  Managed Preview's fixed port override was repaired; provider data is synthetic.
- **Boundaries:** 38 migrations, 0 new/changed; all T18A code before the
  payment-only legacy handler unchanged. Inventory, OCR/AI, recipe/planner, Week,
  production infrastructure/workflows unchanged. No real payment, deployment,
  remote mutation or merge. Main CI #140/staging #51 green, production skipped.
- **Readiness follow-up:** CI `35554499704` green at `2d6ff5a`; no review threads.
  Corrected CSP blocking VietQR in both production policies and removed the
  obsolete grant-secret warning (no infrastructure/binding changes). CSP unit
  and browser decode assertions failed before the fix, then passed. Final
  focused CSP/config/health/payment 104/104 and six-width browser 48/48 PASS;
  lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build, built-header parity and full-diff check
  PASS. One full-diff trailing blank line and a local test-adapter origin mismatch
  were corrected. Exact commands and limitations are in the report; full-suite
  final-head CI must be verified separately, not inferred from the earlier run.
- **Next action:** owner review/merge permission once final-head CI is green; no local blocker.
  Auto-fix is enabled for follow-up, not
  merge/deploy permission. See [exact report](T18B_PAYMENT_AUTHORITY_REPORT.md).

## T18A handoff — `T18A_READY_FOR_REVIEW` (2026-09-21)

- **Identity/base:** `1368281478`, currently `omin-jp/Frigo-dev`; exact main
  `51d0d3755d83b64185066228d98f44ab7bad5e3c`. Branch
  `feat/t18a-auth-resend-expiry-contract`.
- **Publication:** new [PR #46](https://github.com/omin-jp/Frigo-dev/pull/46),
  OPEN against main; CI/review auto-fix enabled. Do not merge or deploy.
- **Durable checkpoints:** server `88096cb7fbea8e3b95f5627ff5a46e8c3d34b462`,
  frontend/browser `47c3a3391e086caf2760b61ee4e2bfacd331cacf`, final security
  fixtures `53f9fefdc9d935bb736a37cdcd9f5b0d0479685e`; each pushed immediately.
- **Implemented:** server-owned `expiresInMinutes` from the storage TTL;
  bounded presentation-only client expiry on resend; honest unknown/missing
  metadata; delivery failure/offline stale-state cleanup unchanged. Reset
  responses expose only generic policy, preserving anti-enumeration. No
  migration, lifetime increase, credential persistence or anti-abuse change.
- **Verification:** final auth/security 300/300; server 86/86 and client 83/83
  focused subsets; full Vitest 180 files/4117 tests; six-viewport T17/T18A
  browser coverage 42/42; lint/typecheck/migration smoke/build/diff check PASS.
  `pnpm test --maxWorkers=2 --minWorkers=2` ran the entire suite, without filters.
  Exact commands and results are in [the report](T18A_AUTH_RESEND_EXPIRY_REPORT.md).
- **Failures/recovery:** missing locked Chromium fixed; browser rerun passed.
  First full run hit 600s shell timeout without a reported test failure;
  extended final run uses all tests. Setup lifecycle claim refusal reported;
  effective durable local setup was safely executed via shell. Platform-only
  settings were preserved in a named stash and excluded from the PR.
- **Boundaries:** billing/payment UI/payment behavior/migrations/other Worker
  code all zero diff from base. T17B history unchanged; T18B payment mismatch
  remains out of scope. Main CI #137 and staging Deploy #50 were verified
  successful for the unchanged base; production job skipped. This branch has
  not been merged or deployed anywhere.
- **Next action:** no local blockers; settle final-head hosted CI and human review of
  PR #46. Auto-fix subscription will deliver subsequent CI/review feedback;
  it is not merge/deploy authorization.
  Implementation-head CI `35549781613` passed; the final documentation SHA
  receives its own hosted run.

## Current handoff — T17B contract reconciliation (2026-09-20)

- **Identity/base:** repository id `1368281478`, `omin-vn/Frigo-dev`; branch
  `feat/t17b-contract-reconciliation`; exact starting main
  `858759f771baccb85f5ed6fd8e06df2fc0bbb112`.
- **Preserved checkpoints:** `029011c` onboarding/registry, `cbbeb1d` verify
  lifecycle, `f0349b6` contract coverage, `fde016a` labelled target
  measurement, `53e950c` delivery/spicy truth, `8b0f050` onboarding preference
  truth, `9a94afb` pending-auth/restriction truth, application HEAD `0f358f2`
  verification-exit/stored-value truth, and certification checkpoint `00594eb`
  settled layout measurement. Initial documentation checkpoint `dd108a2`
  published the evidence; corrective documentation checkpoint `f901b02` fixed
  authority wording and blockers. This publication receipt follows and cannot
  record its own hash.
- **Outcome:** URL-owned onboarding 04–06, screen 06 as a native single-select
  planning goal (`today`/`week`/`both`, client-only, never sent to the server,
  `week` → `/week/setup` after confirmation) with a review of the server-stored
  fields, unclamped household size (stored `6..20` shown as "5+" and
  round-tripped unchanged), server-confirmed completion for authenticated
  sessions, the
  preserved local-only offline-guest exception, owner-bound and
  delivery/expiry-honest `/auth/verify`, stale-request/route cleanup, supported
  spicy-value preservation, verification-exit loading reset, and concrete proof
  for all 27 reviewer-verified registry entries. Screen 05 has exactly seven
  visible cuisine and nine restriction choices (both include `other`) without
  dropping stored `italian`, `vegetarian`, or other authoritative values.
- **Final local evidence:** focused auth 102/102; final verify/onboarding 39/39;
  full Vitest 180 files/4087; registry 18/18; T13 60/60; clean full T17
  216 pass/6 intentional skips; automated accessibility 12/12 across six
  viewports; residual 43/43 payment-allowlisted/0 unjustified; contrast 33/33;
  lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build, focused ESLint, and
  `git diff --check` PASS. Exact commands are in the report.
- **Post-review fix (`56fc01b`):** screen 06 goal restored and household size
  unclamped. Reran focused onboarding/auth **87/87**, full Vitest **180
  files/4094**, registry **18/18**, remaining T17 **198 pass/6 skips**
  (full matrix 216/6/0), lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build,
  `git diff --check`; worker/migration/payment diffs still 0. Logs in
  `.hoplite/artifacts/t17b-validation-p1p2/`. The `00594eb` ZIP's screen 06
  captures are superseded for that screen.
- **Visual artifact:** clean source
  `.hoplite/artifacts/t17-playwright/final-00594eb-clean/`, validation source
  `.hoplite/artifacts/t17b-validation-00594eb/`, inspected contact sheet
  `.hoplite/artifacts/t17b-final-00594eb-contact-sheet.png`; tested 232-entry,
  180-PNG package `.hoplite/artifacts/t17b-final-visuals-00594eb.zip`, SHA-256
  `d6f6d4f032c0ac637ce5d1523ecc95b1411bc567538bca8d235a7131e6ad9d70`.
- **Boundaries:** `src/worker` and protected payment behavior have zero T17B
  diff; migrations also have zero diff.
  `PRE-EXISTING PROTECTED AUTH-CONTRACT BLOCKER`: registration reports
  `expiresInMinutes: 10`, while resend supplies no fresh expiry metadata; a
  server/API owner must resolve it separately.
  `PRE-EXISTING PROTECTED PAYMENT-AUTHORITY BLOCKER`: frontend and VietQR-prop
  prices remain `599000`/`79000`, while payment-intent authority is
  `499000`/`49000`; the QR does not source its amount from that intent. Aligning
  these requires separate owner-authorized payment work. No staging,
  production, or deployment action.
- **Corrective documentation verification:** `git diff --check`, required-marker
  assertions, and fresh Worker/migration/payment zero-diff checks pass. The ZIP
  revalidated at 232 entries/180 PNGs with 180 JSON + 180 TSV records, no missing
  fields/files or hash mismatches, and the recorded SHA-256. An initial ad hoc
  validator looked for `command` instead of the declared `generatingCommand`
  key; the corrected validator passed. Application gates were not rerun because
  this follow-up changes only the six documentation files.
- **Final merge-readiness verification:** focused auth/onboarding/session suites
  reran at 74/74; changed-file ESLint, full typecheck, and `git diff --check`
  passed; protected release/configuration surfaces remained unchanged; and the
  ZIP again passed integrity with recorded SHA-256
  `d6f6d4f032c0ac637ce5d1523ecc95b1411bc567538bca8d235a7131e6ad9d70`.
- **Managed Preview:** an initial inferred `pnpm dev` run path lacked the
  isolated API and guest creation returned 500. Restoring the effective
  `node scripts/security-preview.mjs` path recovered a ready Preview; the
  tracked `.hoplite/settings.json` was restored unchanged. At exact remote
  checkpoint `f901b02`, supported synthetic reset/login verified screens 04–06
  at 390x844, including five household radios, 7 cuisine and 9 restriction
  checkboxes, independent review values, and Back/Forward preservation. No page
  error was reported in the successful flow. The separate real-guest fixture
  endpoint still returned 500 and was not broadened by T17B.
- **Receipt separation:** PR #44/main CI/staging receipts are historical T17;
  T17B replacement PR #45 opened against exact main `858759f` from remote
  checkpoint `f901b02`. At publication head `1cacd0b`, hosted validate run
  `35532565549` passed, GitHub reported `MERGEABLE / CLEAN`, and reviews, review
  comments, conversation comments, and unresolved human feedback were empty.
  Its auto-fix CI/review loop is enabled. T17B itself has not merged or deployed.
- **Status/blockers:** `T17B_COMPLETE`; no in-scope implementation blocker.
  Manual — original boards/ZIP unavailable, final direct board comparison
  pending external reviewer, and `HUMAN_SCREEN_READER = NOT_EXECUTED`.
  Pre-existing protected auth/payment blockers are recorded above, not fixed;
  merge/deploy remain operator decisions.
- **Next exact action:** PR #45 is ready for the authorized user's merge decision
  when the documentation-only readiness checkpoint retains green/CLEAN
  exact-head provider status. Direct package/board comparison and NVDA/VoiceOver
  remain pending; neither has a named assignee or tracking issue in this
  repository. Do not deploy outside the operator path.

## Previous handoff — T17 continuation 6: contract gaps closed, `T17_PARTIAL` (2026-09-19)

- **Branch/PR:** `feat/t17-takosan-ui-v2`, PR #44, repository id `1368281478`
  (`tako-san1/Frigo-dev`). Implementation commits `dfdd0ab`, `227e36b`,
  `8f25fbd`, `463bf29`; docs checkpoint follows (hash cannot be recorded in
  itself — see `git log`).
- **What changed:** `/auth/verify` real route + code-free tab context + honest
  empty state; 27-screen registry certification; 991-site semantic-token
  migration with an enforced residual allowlist (payment UI only); WCAG-AA
  contrast/axe/h1/alt/44px/dialog/OTP certification with product fixes
  (viewport zoom re-enabled, `text-muted` darkened, `BottomSheet` +
  `useModalFocus`); reduced-motion certification on auth/onboarding/sheet/
  dialog/cooking/planner/scan; canonical `scan-review` + state-matrix captures;
  visual-review fixes (canvas width cap, aligned fixed bars, wrappers).
- **Exact verification at final HEAD:** `docs/ai/T17_UI_V2_REPORT.md`
  §Verification (lint, typecheck, full vitest, `check:migrations`, build,
  T13 suite at 360/390/430, T17 suite at 360/390/430/768/1024/1440, residual
  greps, `git diff 769d085 -- src/worker` = 0, payment boundary, `git diff
  --check`, `git status --short`). The old ephemeral artifact directory is no
  longer present; T17B replacement evidence is named in the current handoff.
- **Limitations:** the kit ZIP was not present in the sandbox — board
  comparison and `SCREEN_REGISTRY` diff are outstanding (registry reconstructed
  with per-row `source` tags in `tests/e2e/t17-ui/screen-registry.ts`); no
  human screen-reader walkthrough; virtual keyboard approximated by a shrunk
  viewport. `sqlite3` had to be installed in-session (repo setup script line).
- **Next exact action:** with the original design ZIP in hand, compare the
  T17B package named in the current handoff against the three Takosan boards
  and `screens/*.md`, diff `screen-registry.ts` vs
  `SCREEN_REGISTRY`, run an NVDA/VoiceOver pass over the canonical surfaces;
  fix anything found, then set `T17_COMPLETE`. Do not merge/deploy from this
  branch without the operator path in `DEPLOYMENT.md`.
- **Harness notes:** kill any leftover `security-preview.mjs` on :3000 before
  Playwright; the T17 config clears its output directory per run. T17B used
  isolated per-project output directories to avoid artifact collisions.

## Previous handoff — T17 Takosan UI V2 partial redesign on feat/t17-takosan-ui-v2

### Continuation 4 (same day) — full-diff review, latent defects fixed

### Continuation 5 (same day) — release preparation

- **P1 found from screenshots, not tests:** camelCase `semantic` colour keys in `tailwind.config.js` meant `bg-semantic-action-primary`, `text-semantic-text-*`, `*-soft`, `border-strong` etc. compiled to **no CSS**. Fixed (kebab keys); `takosan-brand.test.tsx` now guards every `semantic-*` utility in `src/web` against the config. Re-verified: vitest 178/4047, T17 390/768/1440 51/51, build PASS.
- **Release path:** PR into `main` opened from this branch; CI hosted must be green; staging deploys automatically from `main`; production is a manual operator dispatch (`Deploy` workflow, `production` Environment, `confirm_production`, full SHA + `hardened_sha`). No new migrations in this branch. The agent does not deploy (rule 19).
- **Still open before `T17_COMPLETE`:** slate-palette migration (856 sites), human design review of the captures (this continuation shows why), WCAG contrast on legacy pages.

**4b addendum:** three more fixes (FoodPreferences onboarding-flag leak; per-nav `layoutId`; dev-OTP `<button>`). **T13 suite first local run: 60/60** after two test-only fixes — `/profile`→`/me` target, and the presentation test's `localStorage.frigo_onboarded` shim (broken on base by migration 0038, not by T17) replaced with the real onboarding flow. Do **not** seed the preview profile as onboarded: the T17 screenshot spec and screens 04-06 need the fresh preview user to land on onboarding. Full T17 matrix green after one more test-only `networkidle` fix (12/12 re-verify, 6 widths). Prefer `--reporter=line` and make sure no `security-preview.mjs` is left listening on :3000 before a Playwright run — a leaked server from a killed run caused spurious 1.0 m timeouts once.

- **Scope:** every file in `git diff 769d085..HEAD` reviewed; 10 product defects + 1 test defect fixed. Table with severity/finding/fix in `docs/ai/T17_UI_V2_REPORT.md` §Continuation 4.
- **Most important:** (P1) new settings pages had unscoped React Query keys — fixed with scoped `queryKeys.foodPreferences()`/`planningPreferences()` and invalidate-after-write; (P1) offline planning save showed success while only queued — now explicit pending-sync copy; (P1) offline planning read hung — now honest unavailable state.
- **IA/layout:** TopBar detects `/me`, navigates to `/me` and `/settings/app` directly; immersive shell is camera-only so `/scan/:id/review` and `/scan/receipt-review` keep navigation; ReceiptReview wrapper removed and its CTA clears the nav; `BottomCTA`/`StickyActions` primitives clear the mobile nav.
- **A11y/motion:** auth fields label-associated with ids, autocomplete, OTP group/digit names, reveal-button name/state, mode switcher `aria-pressed`; Switch gets `aria-describedby` and a transform-driven, reduced-motion-governed thumb; inventory rows fade on enter/exit.
- **Verification:** lint PASS, typecheck PASS, full vitest **178/4046 PASS**, migration smoke PASS, build PASS, focused UI/auth **65/65**, T17 Playwright at 390 + 1440 (33 pass + screenshot timeout fixed test-only, then 6/6 re-verified incl. two new regression assertions). `git diff 769d085 -- src/worker` = 0 lines.
- **Next exact actions:** unchanged — slate-palette semantic migration, human screenshot review before baselining, first local T13 Playwright run. Status `T17_PARTIAL`.

### Continuation 3 (same day, same branch)

- **Scoped transitions:** named `transition-tap` token added to tailwind (explicit `transform, background-color, border-color, color, box-shadow, opacity`; layout never transitions); all 86 `transition-all` sites across 32 files migrated; zero remain.
- **Motion stories:** cooking steps slide directionally (+24px forward, reverse on Back; timers never depend on animation frames); inventory rows animate add/remove/layout via AnimatePresence + layout keyed by stable server identity (instant under reduced motion); scan camera→processing crossfade verified already reduced-motion-safe over preserved context.
- **State matrix:** new suite tests — inventory bottom sheet (labelled/closable/in-viewport), honest offline banner (driven by browser offline/online events; Playwright `setOffline` only fails requests and is not this component's trigger), and 200% text-zoom survival on Home/Fridge/Recipes/Shopping/Profile.
- **Real zoom bugs fixed:** the 200% gate exposed rem-sized nav icons forcing flex min-content overflow, Profile-hub/Home truncation gaps, unwrappable RecipeCard meta and IngredientRow action rows, and a missing `min-w-0` on the inventory search. Verified clean by probe at 390 and 360 (desktop and mobile emulation) and by the suite at all six widths (settled measurement).
- **Gates:** lint PASS, typecheck PASS, full vitest **178/4046 PASS**, migration smoke PASS, build PASS (436.34 kB / 120.90 kB gzip). Full T17 matrix run passed except two test-code defects (case-sensitive offline regex; zoom measured pre-settle) — fixed test-only and re-verified **12/12** at all six widths; no product code changed after the full-suite run.
- **Next exact actions:** (1) migrate the 856 remaining `slate-*` neutral-palette sites on legacy pages to semantic tokens (brand `takosan-*` aliases may stay per the kit); (2) human design-review of the canonical screenshots before baselining; (3) first local run of the T13 Playwright inventory suite. Status stays `T17_PARTIAL`.
- **Safety:** worker/PayOS diff zero; `main` untouched; production untouched.

### Continuation 2 (same day, same branch)

- **Auth decomposed:** `AuthPage.tsx` is now a state machine composing `src/web/features/auth/*` (AuthShell, LoginMode, RegisterMode, OtpMode, ForgotPasswordMode, GoogleAuthSection, AuthField, auth-shared) with the kit's auth-state transition. Security semantics byte-compatible (Turnstile single-use token rotation, GSI retry/width/credential-only contract, DEC-012 deferred guest transfer with explicit continue-without-transfer, private-session capture, exact server error mapping). Auth suites **11/11 PASS**.
- **Dead animation classes retired:** the plugin that defines `animate-in`/`zoom-in-95`/`slide-in-from-*` was never installed, so those classes did nothing; all 15 occurrences moved to the real reduced-motion-gated `animate-fade-in`/`animate-slide-up`. Zero remain (`rg` proves absence).
- **Visual matrix complete:** T17 config certifies 360/390/430/768/1024/1440; 17 canonical screenshots captured per certified width under `.hoplite/artifacts/t17-playwright/results/t17-screenshots.e2e.ts-*`; destructive-dialog focus-trap/Escape/focus-return and empty-inbox honesty asserted. The 360 run exposed a real `/shopping` overflow (quick-add input refused to shrink) — fixed with `min-w-0` and re-probed at scrollWidth 360.
- **Gates after continuation:** lint PASS, typecheck PASS, full vitest **178 files / 4046 tests PASS**, migration smoke PASS, build PASS (index 436.21 kB / 120.84 kB gzip), T17 Playwright **42/42 PASS** at certified widths, full 6-width matrix green.
- **Next exact actions:** (1) migrate per-screen motion to the shared primitives (inventory list layout, scan crossfade, cooking-step direction, planner layout) and replace indiscriminate `transition-all`; (2) extend the state-class matrix (bottom sheet, long Vietnamese text, loading/offline) and human design-review the screenshots before baselining; (3) per-screen semantic-token migration for legacy-styled pages (Home, Inventory, Recipes, Week fallbacks, scan/cooking). Status stays `T17_PARTIAL` until those are evidenced.
- **Safety:** worker diff zero again this continuation; PayOS/payment untouched; `main` untouched; no deploy.

- **Branch/base:** `feat/t17-takosan-ui-v2` from live remote main `769d08597563f816ef9c1dd9523fdafb687de3e2`; `main` untouched, no merge/deploy. Status **`T17_PARTIAL`**; full evidence and exact gaps in `docs/ai/T17_UI_V2_REPORT.md`, audit in `docs/ai/T17_UI_V2_AUDIT.md`.
- **Design contract:** attached `takosan-redesign-os-v2.0.0.zip` (kit read in full: rules, tokens, layout, motion, states, components, 27 screens, engineering, QA). Kit assets that a prior migration had missed (search/notification/expiry/settings/budget/nutrition/scan/shopping-list/leaf icons) were installed under `public/takosan/`.
- **Implementation:** semantic token layer (CSS `--semantic-*` + tailwind `semantic-*`, type/radius/elevation scales); `motion@13.4.0` + `MotionConfig reducedMotion="user"` provider and motion primitives; shared primitives module; AppShell V2 (mobile bottom nav / tablet rail / desktop sidebar, immersive-only hiding, real links + `aria-current`; legacy `BottomNav` retired with migrated test); settings IA split with dedicated pages over real GET/PATCH `/preferences` and `/week/preferences`, `/settings/notifications`, `/settings/privacy`, `/settings/app`, honest household/privacy unavailable states replacing fabricated flows; inbox/preferences separated; planner canonical with param-preserving Week redirects (flag-gated, flag-off keeps Week rollout surface); onboarding step routes; phone-width emulation removed from 20+ pages; fixed CTAs clear nav/rail/sidebar; Landing/Auth h1; zero emerald/user-visible "Frigo Plus".
- **Verification:** baseline on `769d085` and post-implementation both: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm test` **178 files / 4046 tests**, `pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build` all PASS; new isolated suite `pnpm exec playwright test --config playwright.t17.config.ts` **33/33 PASS** at 390/768/1440 (sqlite3 CLI installed in-session as the repo setup script does; Playwright chromium downloaded in-session). Test changes are documented and justified (MotionProvider in the shell-ancestry assertion, MemoryRouter wrapping for the inbox link, navigation primitive in the brand test) — no coverage weakened.
- **PayOS/payment:** zero application change — `git diff 769d085 -- src/worker` is empty; the only payment-path diff is 12/12 presentation-only lines in `VietQRModal.tsx`; billing service functions untouched.
- **Known limits / next exact actions:** (1) decompose `AuthPage.tsx` (930 lines) into `features/auth/*` with mode-presence transitions keeping auth tests green; (2) migrate per-screen motion + semantic tokens on legacy-styled pages; (3) extend the T17 suite to 360/430/1024, the state-class matrix and canonical screenshots; (4) full a11y (contrast/zoom/SR) pass. Only then consider `T17_COMPLETE`.
- **Safety:** no production/D1/R2/PayOS mutation, no canary change, Inventory Truth/OCR/AI/recipe authority/planning algorithms untouched; `.hoplite/settings.json` is platform-managed session metadata excluded from T17 commits.

## Current handoff — T16 PWA cache and Google recovery deployed

- **Branch/base:** `codex/auth-pwa-cache-google-recovery` from canonical main `ff07773ce8e146923870698928a1b8b4c451f8e6`.
- **Root cause:** production `/auth` and `/sw.js` were Cloudflare cache hits; app registration used `/sw.js` while `_headers` configured `/service-worker.js`; worker cache name was fixed at `takosan-pwa-v2`. A clean browser loaded real Google GIS and opened the Google account popup, isolating the reported GIS failure to stale/blocked client state rather than the backend credential contract.
- **Implementation:** release SHA is injected into `dist/client/sw.js`; registration uses `/sw.js?v=<sha>` plus `updateViaCache: none`; update checks run on load/online/foreground; activation removes only prior Takosan caches, claims clients, then best-effort navigates stale same-origin clients once; navigation refreshes cached `/index.html`; cache writes are awaited. Google button width is numeric/clamped and retry script errors are explicit.
- **Headers/workflow:** effective `/auth` and `/sw.js` policy is no-store, hashed assets are immutable without inherited no-store, and deploy builds receive the exact SHA. Exact-SHA convergence now precedes smoke; smoke validates the shell/worker/asset headers plus embedded Worker SHA.
- **Verification:** focused 116/116, full Vitest 178 files / 4046 tests, lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build, shell syntax and diff check PASS. Local Wrangler returned the intended effective headers. Two-release Chromium proved one clean-install document request, one update navigation, exact new controller and only the new release cache.
- **Browser limit:** no release can force a closed, suspended or browser-blocked old tab to execute new code. Awaiting its navigation inside Service Worker activation deadlocks the document fetch, so refresh is best-effort after claim; reload/reopen/navigation is the reliable recovery path, and clients on this release gain load/online/foreground checks for future updates.
- **Recorded non-gate failure:** `pnpm audit --audit-level high` reports the unchanged lockfile's 21 advisories / 6 high in Wrangler/Miniflare, jsdom and build-time sharp paths. No dependency changed here and these packages are not added to the browser runtime; handle in a separate reviewed dependency upgrade.
- **Merge/deploy receipt:** PR #42 head `54dd81b3ba260843ed39d625c8e0b7c2f4cef831` passed CI `35415335137`, merged as main `6a016f185cae9c51ab5a1fc873a8a05a10a57edd`, then passed exact-main CI `35415536459` and staging Deploy `35415763483`. Protected production Deploy `35415843682` succeeded on Worker `2f228dc9-d97b-4eb1-8cff-9a0f2df3b51c`, D1 ledger 38 / tip 0038, recipe `shadow/0/false`.
- **Production verification:** readiness identifies the exact main SHA; DB/queue are OK and only `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING` remains. `/auth` is current + no-store (Cloudflare Assets reports HIT), `/sw.js` is MISS + no-store and embeds the exact SHA, hashed assets are immutable. Clean Chromium opened the real Google account chooser and showed the exact-SHA controller plus sole matching Takosan cache.
- **Safety:** no migration, D1/R2/customer-data write, payment/PayOS change, Canary activation, full-D1 cutover, Inventory Truth change or Week change. Real inbox OTP receipt remains a separate manual evidence item.

## Current handoff — T15C-D production 1% Canary blocked before mutation (2026-09-19)

- **Canonical base:** repository `1368281478` / `frigo-6/Frigo-dev`; main and task base `347b536950cf54d25a2d6a880c3c2cb3d8c8f329`; branch `codex/t15c-production-canary-1pct`.
- **Merged prerequisites:** PR #38 -> `8163f05ed1af361f9c0658361df745227e6eae20`; PR #39 -> `347b536950cf54d25a2d6a880c3c2cb3d8c8f329`. Exact-main CI `35409762462` and staging Deploy `35409964105` succeeded; production job was skipped and staging stayed `static/0/false`.
- **Fresh gates:** frozen install, seed/import, typecheck, lint, migration smoke through 0038, build, diff check, and full Vitest **178 files / 4044 tests** passed.
- **Production read-only evidence:** Deploy `35404106102`, Worker `6c336889-680d-4cc3-b03b-1007849aa738`, SHA `b41aa468...`, `shadow/0/false`; readiness config-valid with DB/queue/email OK and only `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING`; 5/5 recipe reads served the same 71 IDs, legacy details returned 200, sampled D1-only details returned 404.
- **Safe stop:** no authorized operator-owned INCLUDE and EXCLUDE household pair was supplied; customer/user IDs were not searched. Local Wrangler is unauthenticated, so no fresh direct D1/tail audit or secret provisioning was possible. No production mutation occurred. Classification `T15C_D_BLOCKED_AUTHORIZED_TEST_HOUSEHOLDS_UNAVAILABLE`.
- **Receipt merge:** commit `16958c605c1d4659591f2c02faecf593d81a7a6a` passed exact-head CI `35410893001`; PR #40 merged as `763d7e904798dc513c60d4da5f876598570c12fb`; exact-main CI `35411093064` and automatic staging Deploy `35411300235` passed on `static/0/false`, with production skipped.
- **Next exact action:** privately supply the two operator-owned household IDs, authenticate the intended Cloudflare operator session, repeat direct D1 certification, provision the three hashed cohort Worker secrets without printing IDs/digests, prove Shadow remains inert, deploy exactly 1% through protected `deploy.yml`, certify EXCLUDE then INCLUDE plus E2E/telemetry, and rollback to `shadow/0/false` with secrets retained. Receipt: `recipe-catalog/T15C_D_PRODUCTION_1PCT_CANARY_CERTIFICATION.md`.

## Current handoff — T15C-C authorized test cohort mechanism ready, dormant (2026-09-19)

- **Base/branch:** canonical main `b41aa4682481447795350fc1a9eeb1e80887bd0e`; branch `hoplite/aigeai-eca96ae8--t15c-cohort` (PR in body). Implementation `c5d2d63aa06ad51727aaeac6bd6cf01349598e29`.
- **What:** secret-configured include/exclude digest sets let operator-owned test households prove INSIDE/OUTSIDE 1% canary without touching the customer algorithm or adding any request-controlled switch. Default disabled; parsed/validated only in `canary` mode with cutover — inert in static/shadow/d1 so rollback is a single mode change with no secret cleanup (review P1 resolved); an active cohort requires both an include and an exclude household (`TEST_COHORT_PAIR_REQUIRED`, review P2 resolved); fail-closed validation; no IDs/digests in logs, readiness, API, manifest, workflow, or wrangler config. Details/setup/rollback: `recipe-catalog/T15C_AUTHORIZED_TEST_COHORT.md`.
- **Production:** unchanged — `shadow / 0 / false`, Worker == main. Classification `T15C_AUTHORIZED_TEST_COHORT_READY`; canary activation remains a separate authorized T15C-B step.
## Current handoff — T15C production Canary safe stop (2026-09-18, after T16 merges)

- **Base:** canonical main `b41aa4682481447795350fc1a9eeb1e80887bd0e` (unchanged during the session); docs-only branch `hoplite/aigeai-eca96ae8--t15c-canary`.
- **Production (read-only, public endpoints):** Worker commit == main, authority `shadow / 0 / false` per Deploy 35404106102 receipt, 71 served deterministically, D1-only IDs 404. D1 aggregates not re-queried (no credential here) — historical from T15C-B: 500 / tip 0037 / `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4` / media 500 pending, 0 ready.
- **Blocker:** authorized inside/outside 1% cohorts and Cloudflare credentials unavailable → `T15C_CANARY_BLOCKED_AUTHORIZED_COHORT_UNAVAILABLE`. No production mutation of any kind. Receipt + resume steps: `recipe-catalog/T15C_PRODUCTION_CANARY_SAFE_STOP.md`.

## Current handoff — T16 OTP resend and guest account gates ready for release

- **Branch/base:** `codex/auth-otp-guest-account-gates` from canonical main `14f06ff7f3ede72e676e2cb42b9949cca074a070`; this checkpoint contains the application, tests and documentation candidate, while production is unchanged.
- **Implementation checkpoint:** `31006994849ee9f6d78ae6114f82d77d41efc784` (`fix(auth): restore OTP resend and gate guest upgrades`).
- **Confirmed root cause:** the real Cloudflare Email Service binding rejects `no-reply@frigo.tungjpstore.net` because that subdomain is not onboarded as a sending domain. The onboarded apex sender `no-reply@tungjpstore.net` was accepted and returned a provider `messageId`. Do not claim inbox delivery until a real OTP message is received.
- **OTP fix:** `src/worker/services/email.ts` uses the apex sender and sanitizes the known subdomain error. `src/worker/routes/auth.ts` tolerates optional KV cooldown outages, releases cooldown after failed sends, and returns `503 OTP_RESEND_UNAVAILABLE` for unexpected failures. `src/web/pages/AuthPage.tsx` requires and renews a Turnstile token for resend.
- **Guest UX:** guest `/plus` shows an account-required state with `/auth?mode=login&returnTo=%2Fplus`, never the price cards or `VietQRModal`. The guest profile CTA links directly to that login path. Auth accepts guest sessions and safe local `returnTo` routing sends an onboarded account back to Plus after login.
- **Payment boundary:** no PayOS, billing, checkout, payment webhook or settlement code changed; authenticated users retain the existing pricing/payment flow.
- **Verification:** focused **86 tests / 4 files PASS**; full `pnpm test` **176 files / 4008 tests PASS**; `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:migrations` (`migration-smoke=ok`), `pnpm build`, and `git diff --check` PASS. Browser checks at 390x844 and 1440x1000 confirmed the guest gate and return path.
- **Production pre-state:** Worker `e8164168-9566-475b-b0fa-7508368bf3e7`, main `0cb5d2c08fa24479ecce6b4c4e5f73b31a920ff5`, D1 ledger 38 / tip 0038, recipe `shadow/0/false`; only the known `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING` readiness warning.
- **Next exact action:** commit coherently, push/open PR, require exact-head CI and review, merge normally, require exact-main CI, dispatch `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` with production confirmation and `shadow/0/false`, verify exact SHA/ledger/readiness, then use a normal browser to request/resend one OTP and confirm receipt without recording the code.

## Current handoff — T16 production and CSP hotfix deployed; OTP receipt pending

- **Merged release:** PR #34 contains implementation `3633a2fa8a0827a6aa31a3c86da7fb680a6e0f2a` plus docs `66e8073161cf418ffe4df2ed6cece75d56087af1`, merged as main `d6c981b1a67001b807f03166109f661bc753728c`. PR CI `35385363064` and exact-main CI `35385844667` passed.
- **User-facing result:** landing has two explicit choices; auth supports query-driven registration/Google entry; returning users skip completed onboarding; new users see three preference-only steps; onboarding has no duplicate account or unsupported Apple choice.
- **OTP/email:** `src/worker/services/email.ts` uses the structured Cloudflare Email Service API and sanitized error categories, with Resend fallback. Production delivery failure invalidates the challenge and register/resend return honest `503 OTP_DELIVERY_UNAVAILABLE`; development still exposes `devOtp` for local tests.
- **Google:** `/config` exposes the runtime `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`; frontend GIS and backend `aud` validation use that same value. Missing config fails clearly, retry reloads the GIS script, and no credential-less production fallback exists.
- **Persistence:** migration `0038_auth_onboarding_completion.sql` adds `profiles.onboarding_completed_at`; `/me`, auth responses, the auth store, and `SessionBoundary` hydrate server authority. `PATCH /preferences` validates input and batches preferences with completion.
- **Production D1:** workflow `35386276549` applied only 0038; ledger 38/tip `0038_auth_onboarding_completion.sql`; bookmark `000000d3-00000000-000050ea-709daab542439d8e8fab731b65dab714`; FK, quick check, aggregate drift, recipe media and catalog certification passed.
- **Production deploy:** workflow `35386532369` succeeded after Environment approval. Worker `c0161a22-1987-42dd-99c4-0a5874d4fadb` serves exact SHA `d6c981b1a67001b807f03166109f661bc753728c`; rollback Worker `c6fa2ce8-f35b-4485-ad38-09dbc19738d1`. Recipe settings are unchanged at `shadow/0/false`. Readiness is exact-SHA and operational, degraded only by existing `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING`; post-deploy smoke passed.
- **Browser evidence:** production Playwright at 390x844 and 1440x900 found no overflow; Google GIS rendered and opened Google Accounts without an origin error. The live guest path survived reload, completed all three onboarding steps, persisted preferences with HTTP 200, reached `/`, and retained the secure `__Host-frigo_session` attributes.
- **CSP hotfix release:** implementation `79dfca6483d90fcf33380acfe33f880c1e6ff7a5`; PR #35 head `c14a3755d95ddae316d5e6636ef85f9784ac4a54`; PR CI `35388666150`; merge/main `0cb5d2c08fa24479ecce6b4c4e5f73b31a920ff5`; exact-main CI `35388963509`. The policy adds only the required Google Fonts/GSI and Cloudflare Insights origins, with no wildcard or script `unsafe-inline`.
- **Hotfix production deploy:** workflow `35389274233` / production job `105743646947` succeeded after Environment approval. Worker `e8164168-9566-475b-b0fa-7508368bf3e7` serves exact merge SHA; previous Worker `c0161a22-1987-42dd-99c4-0a5874d4fadb` is the immediate rollback reference. Full gates, exact-head CI recheck, read-only ledger/schema gate, smoke and one-attempt convergence passed. Manifest and live API remain `shadow/0/false`, 71 recipes, ledger 38/tip 0038.
- **Independent hotfix verification:** readiness exact SHA; DB/queue/email configured; only `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING` warning. Mobile/desktop Playwright loaded fonts and one Google iframe with no overflow or CSP console violation. The Insights request was no longer CSP-blocked but its external host refused the connection from the verification network.
- **UX audit:** repository audit remains FAIL with 19 issues / 686 warnings / 47 passed; pages-only audit remains FAIL with 6 issues / 303 warnings / 15 passed. Reported issues are existing unrelated pages/tests/styles, not the T16 landing/auth/onboarding surfaces.
- **Remaining limitation:** real OTP delivery is not certified. `tungjpstore@gmail.com` already exists; automated headed and headless Chrome displayed the real Turnstile checkbox but did not produce a token. No forgot-password request was sent and no email receipt may be claimed. One legitimate production guest test record remains by design.
- **Safety boundary:** no PayOS/payment, recipe authority, canary percentage, Inventory Truth, Week behavior, media/R2, or unrelated production setting changed.
- **Next exact action:** in a normal user browser, open Forgot password for the existing account, complete Turnstile, submit once, and confirm the email arrived without exposing the OTP. No code, migration, or deploy action is otherwise pending.

## Current handoff — T15C-B merged control plane; authorized-cohort safe stop (2026-09-18)

PR #32 merged with expected head `a7b3d23f2ad8b48203328116d0e35425390d2127` as
`a6e81cd89b9e4c6b923cfc39947b01faf44ff5f3`. Exact-head PR CI `35344089103`,
unresolved threads `0`, and exact-main CI `35347246583` / job `105606601599`
are SUCCESS. Automatic Deploy `35347579284` passed release and staging, skipped
production, and its release/staging manifests are `static/0/false`; staging
deployed the exact merge SHA on Worker `12623f3b-ac64-4255-9fbf-c429b6225e1d`.

Production was rechecked read-only and remains Shadow/static user authority on
Worker `c6fa2ce8-f35b-4485-ad38-09dbc19738d1`, SHA
`88e8b54de121125866b2ff813e56e33277decf1c`: five catalog responses at 71,
legacy IDs 200, reviewed D1-only IDs 404. D1 `frigo-db` remains ledger 37 / tip
0037, 500 recipes, 500 runtime fields, 500 pending media / 0 ready; all SELECTs
reported `changes=0`, `rows_written=0`, and fresh aggregate catalog certification
passed at 500 recipes / 2 approved batches / release `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`.
No migration, D1 write, R2/media write, or production deployment occurred in
this task.

The required authorized operator-owned inside-1% and outside-1% production test
cohorts were unavailable in repository/env/operator inputs. No arbitrary customer
households were inspected. Production Canary was not dispatched, so no
Environment approval was requested and no Canary certification fields exist.
Classification: `T15C_B_AUTHORIZED_TEST_COHORT_UNAVAILABLE`.

Next exact action: an authorized operator provides both cohorts; then recheck
production pre-state and dispatch exactly 1% through the protected workflow.
Do not widen above 1%, enable full D1, populate media/R2, start T14G, or modify
Inventory Truth/T09/T11, PayOS, or auth. Durable receipt:
`docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T15C_B_AUTHORIZED_COHORT_SAFE_STOP.md`.

## Current handoff — T15C-A bounded canary control plane (stop before activation)

- **Base:** certified main `6f589d0201499a3729d343e42ccb6d19fdff217a`; branch `codex/t15c-canary-control-plane`.
- **Remote closures:** PR #31 merged normally as `6f589d0…` after exact head `bb14ba3d…`; PR #29 closed, not merged, with a supersession comment. Automatic Deploy `35340976739` passed release/staging and skipped production.
- **Implementation:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` exposes only `static|shadow|canary`; canary choices are strings `0|1|2|5`; `scripts/release-check.mjs` validates the full combination and derives cutover; manifest/output/Wrangler propagation binds mode, percent, and cutover. Runtime authority files are unchanged.
- **Receipt:** `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T15C_A_CANARY_CONTROL_PLANE.md` distinguishes runtime support from production authorization and documents T15C-B only.
- **Verification:** focused 121/121; full `pnpm test` 173 files / 3995 tests; `pnpm recipe:seed:check`, `pnpm recipe:import:check`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build`, and `git diff --check` PASS. Migration 0036 SHA-256 `04228788e60d59a2427d70956d4d8a108d0a6c1c4a643c47641402f658120ba9`; 0037 SHA-256 `68e52e6d8b9d44054f609a3d405c9fa329d093521ffc8c97009c76fbf7317ad6`; no 0038.
- **Safety:** no production redeploy, canary activation, D1 write/migration dispatch, R2/media population, T14G, T09/T11, PayOS/auth, force-push, or history rewrite. Production remains Shadow/static user authority with 71 served and D1 500 READY per T15B receipt.
- **Canary PR:** #32 is open and mergeable. In-file checkpoints through `642b4f8bc88c4a5987c047570ef408ef277efd1b` passed exact-head CI. The authoritative final head, final CI run, unresolved-thread count, and production recheck are recorded in the PR's post-publication receipt because this file cannot contain the hash of its own commit.
- **Next exact action:** confirm that PR receipt, then independent review of PR #32. Do not merge, dispatch production, activate canary, or widen the policy in this task.

## Current — T15B-SHADOW production certification complete; stop before canary (2026-09-18)

See `recipe-catalog/T15B_SHADOW_CERTIFICATION.md` for the durable receipt. Canonical repository `1368281478` is `frigo-6/Frigo-dev`; PR #30 head `ad3e1d1656418aaf495b130443d6514926b8bdca` merged as main `88e8b54de121125866b2ff813e56e33277decf1c` with zero tree delta. Exact-main CI `35336548833` succeeded. Automatic staging Deploy `35336830786` succeeded and remained STATIC71 on Worker `580acb76-a006-4c0a-b991-618ebde07e88`.

Production Shadow Deploy `35337110268` succeeded after the normal required Environment reviewer gate: release job `105574386006`, production job `105574426707`, Worker `c6fa2ce8-f35b-4485-ad38-09dbc19738d1`, exact SHA convergence in one attempt / 574 ms. The immutable manifest records `recipeCatalogMode=shadow`, schema tip 0037 and ledger 37. Existing production D1 migration run `35329772751` was not rerun and no manual/additional D1 write occurred.

Independent production certification performed five repeated readiness/catalog checks: every request returned exact SHA and 71 user-facing recipes; `vn-canh-01` and `gl-12` remained HTTP 200; five reviewed imported IDs remained HTTP 404. Sanitized Cloudflare tail diagnostics proved `catalog_mode=shadow`, `catalog_source=static`, D1 500 complete/hydrated, release `rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4` READY, zero drift/order/hydration errors, zero Shadow errors, and no authority leak. Previous Worker `ab8ff038-2aaa-468b-a9de-8c5d94f14052` remains retained; rollback is the approved Deploy workflow with the same SHA and `recipe_catalog_mode=static` plus normal approval.

Next action: independent review of the docs-only receipt PR. Do not merge stale/conflicting PR #29 as-is. Do not enable canary, full D1, or cutover; do not populate media/R2; do not start T14G; do not modify Inventory Truth/T09/T11, PayOS, or auth. Classification: `T15B_SHADOW_COMPLETE`.

## Previous — T15B-PRE STATIC certified; SHADOW wiring PR ready (superseded 2026-09-18)

See `recipe-catalog/T15B_PRE_STATIC_RECEIPT.md` for the durable receipt. Main stayed at `0fe2cf071693208f6c642d8cbd994f5a79b5a2cf`; PR #29 was not merged. Existing D1 migration run `35329772751` is SUCCESS at 0037/500 and was not rerun. Static Deploy run `35333517052` is SUCCESS with required Environment approval, Worker version `ab8ff038-2aaa-468b-a9de-8c5d94f14052`, exact SHA convergence in one attempt/587 ms, and five repeated live STATIC71 checks. Previous Worker `56979cb5-e1a8-4241-8a4c-2432d41cc439` remains available for rollback.

No approved Shadow switch existed in the certified main workflow/config path, so no undocumented Cloudflare mutation was attempted. PR #30 from `codex/t15b-shadow-wiring` adds only validated `static|shadow` deploy input/manifest propagation plus tests; canary/full-D1 remain unavailable. Full local gates pass: focused 99/99; lint, typecheck, full 173 files/3976 tests, migration smoke, build, diff-check. Implementation head `97aff50d…` exact CI `35335079345` is SUCCESS; require independent review and final docs-head exact CI, then stop. Do not merge, activate Shadow, enable canary/full D1, write R2/media, start T14G, change Inventory Truth/T09/T11, PayOS, auth, or production infrastructure.

## Current — T15A pre-production hardening COMPLETE; Phase B (production) not started

See `recipe-catalog/T15A_WIP_HANDOFF.md` for the final T15A-R receipt: PR #27 merged to main `0fe2cf071693208f6c642d8cbd994f5a79b5a2cf` (merge commit by maintainer; certified head `776422fb…`; tree delta 0), exact-main CI SUCCESS, automatic staging deploy SUCCESS with exact-SHA convergence through `wait-for-deployed-release.mjs`, production job SKIPPED. Historical last verified production tip = 0034; Phase B must re-query the live ledger before any mutation. No production D1/R2/deploy/authority change has occurred.

## Current T14F — T14F_DEVELOPMENT_COMPLETE (T14F-C certified + closed; production untouched)

T14F-C ran on top of the certified T14F-B base `7d667523…` and completed the 500-recipe development certification: 0037 promoted byte-identical to the certified factory artifact (`68e52e6d…`), `approved-batches.json` + shipped manifest regenerated to 500 recipes / 2 batches (`rel-bd00a4f53fcaeee4`, manifest `fa47d31f…`), fresh/staged/production-forward replay PASS, D1 readiness READY 500, static/shadow/canary/full-D1 authority PASS, and user flows incl. Batch B recipes across six cuisines PASS. Certificate: `recipe-catalog/T14F_C_500_CATALOG_CERTIFICATION.md` (with the closure section).

**Closure executed** (safe stop `44c0ad38…` resolved): `pnpm lint` PASS, `pnpm build` PASS, full `pnpm test` **171/171 files, 3913/3913 tests** (419.6 s), `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:migrations` (smoke through 0037), `pnpm recipe:seed:check`, `pnpm recipe:import:check` (500/2), `git diff --check` PASS; working tree clean. Hosted validate on `44c0ad38…` (run 35266591460) was cancelled by a runner shutdown, then on rerun **failed** the five real-D1 suites (`Error: Network connection lost`): replaying 0001→0037 in one workerd overflows the 1 MiB prepared-statement cache in workerd 1.20250718, whose eviction segfaults (cloudflare/workerd#5977). Fix `8c6080aa…` is tests-only (`tests/helpers/local-d1-worker.mjs`: persisted local D1, one batch per migration, workerd restart before the cache would overflow); real-D1 suites 5 files / 92 tests PASS. No migration, catalog, runtime, Inventory Truth, PayOS or auth change. A second, distinct closure blocker then surfaced on the docs-only heads: the hosted Vitest step passed 171/3913 but exited 1 with an unhandled `[vitest-worker]: Timeout calling "onTaskUpdate"` (birpc 60 s reply timeout starved by long synchronous SqliteD1 suites on the 2-vCPU runner). Fixed forward-only with `tests/helpers/vitest-event-loop-yield.ts` (vitest `setupFiles`, one `setImmediate` yield per test) — test config only.

Final head and hosted exact-head validate SUCCESS (run/job ids) are bound in the PR #25 **final certification receipt**; PR #25 is marked ready for review and stays **unmerged**. Next action: **STOP.** Merge is a separate explicit decision after independent review. Production rollout (production ledger → 0036/0037 via the OPS migration workflow with `EXPECTED_PRE_TIP`, D1 readiness READY 500 verify, shadow → canary → d1), media population and T14G each require separate authorization. Production currently does **not** contain 500 recipes. `recipe-catalog/T14F_C_WIP_HANDOFF.md` is historical only — do not resume from it.

### T14F-A — pilot certified (earlier)

- Recovery: repository ID 1368281478; `frigo-4/Frigo-dev`; `hoplite/massalia-c2862d7c`;
  main `f0c229f2…` unchanged; start `8079a37` inspected as a compatible test-only fix.
- Implementation: `2ee6f5cc0e144e5c522ce91bd005ab61dc124ed5`. The legacy routing suite uses
  a generated test-local 71 release, verifies actual D1/canary selection and null fallback,
  retains first batch `[5]` / cached `[]`, rejects and does not cache semantic drift,
  and cleans up its mock. Timestamp fix `486409c…` and production semantics preserved.
- Failure history: reproduced pre-remediation 5/7; independent 71/101 mismatch diagnostics
  confirm correct COUNT_DRIFT/static fallback. Both stale-fixture failures are resolved.
- Verification: routing 8/8, growth 21/21, combined 29/29 twice, focused subsystem 383/383;
  independent serial/non-isolated 29/29; no P0/P1/P2 review blocker. Executed seed/import,
  typecheck, lint, migration smoke, build, full `pnpm test`, diff: all PASS;
  full suite 171/171 files, 3911/3911 tests. Exact commands are in the next handoff.
- Hosted implementation validate **35223589293 / 105209475052 SUCCESS**. The
  [final certification receipt](https://github.com/frigo-4/Frigo-dev/pull/25#issuecomment-5714709031)
  binds the final documentation head to its own hosted SUCCESS; required for a valid T14F-B base.
- Pilot remains 30 + legacy 71 = 101 READY, complete 101/order 0..100, five statements/no N+1;
  fresh/staged replay, authority modes, imported HTTP flows and inventory regressions pass.
  Pilot sources/review/registry/manifest, 0036 hash and all historical migration bytes unchanged.
- Next action: **STOP.** Await separate T14F-B authorization; start only from the final SHA
  in the receipt, not an earlier implementation SHA. No ingredient scale preflight, Batch B,
  0037, 500 manifest, production mutation/deploy/switch, media population or T14G.
  PR #25 stays draft/unmerged and auto-fix subscribed. Pre-existing local settings delta preserved.
- Durable recovery, exact commands and hashes: `recipe-catalog/T14F_NEXT_HANDOFF.md`;
  full history: `T14F_REAL_CATALOG_GROWTH.md`; pilot quality: `T14F_CATALOG_QUALITY_REPORT.md`.

## Historical handoffs (not current T14F status)

## Current handoff — T14F WIP SAFE STOP on `feat/t14f-recipe-catalog-500`; pilot 30 compiled + 0036 promoted; ONE focused test failing; Batch B not started (2026-09-17)

- **Implementation state:** uncommitted T14F pilot WIP checkpointed and pushed on
  `feat/t14f-recipe-catalog-500` (base `f0c229f2…` = T14E certified main, still origin/main). See
  `docs/ai/recipe-catalog/T14F_WIP_HANDOFF.md` for the authoritative state, hashes and next steps.
- **Pilot:** `data/recipe-import/t14f/pilot-30.jsonl` (30 original recipes, reviewed) → T14E compile
  30/30 publishable, 0 duplicates / 0 unresolved ingredients → `migrations/0036_recipe_catalog_pilot.sql`
  byte-identical to artifact; manifest `rel-193ac2b16c64a260` = 101 recipes / 1 approved batch;
  `ALL_RECIPES` stays 71; migrations 36 / tip 0036; 0001–0035 unchanged.
- **Verification:** typecheck, `check:migrations`, seed check, import check, diff check PASS. Focused
  growth suites 20/21: `production forward path 0034 → 0035 → growth` fails only when both growth
  suites run together (passes alone; root cause unknown — fix before any Batch B work). Lint, build,
  full `pnpm test`, bundle accounting NOT run.
- **Next exact step:** checkout the branch, reproduce/fix the failing growth test (test isolation only —
  do NOT regenerate data or 0036), then continue the T14F packet pilot gate before Batch B.
- **Not done:** Batch B (399), final 500 manifest, QA/architecture docs, PR, production anything.

## Current handoff — T14E remediation (P1/P2/P3) on the feature branch; PR #23 unmerged, awaiting re-review (2026-09-17)

- **Implementation state:** forward commit after `7b4edcc8…`. `packages/recipes/src/import/{types,schema,normalize,compiler,
  sql-render,release-manifest}.ts`: `nutritionEvidence` + `duplicateReview` on the normalized model; `canonicalBatchProjection`
  (single hash projection); SQL renders `nutrition_profiles` (`<id>_nutrition_v1`, per serving, source_type/source_reference from the
  reviewed evidence) + `recipe_nutrition` rows; `normalized-recipes.json` carries batch metadata (incl. license/usageNote) and per-recipe
  evidence/review; `NUTRITION_EVIDENCE_LOST` guard. `recipe-authority.ts`: error union `D1_READ_FAILED | RELEASE_MANIFEST_INVALID`;
  manifest supplier failure ⇒ `RELEASE_MANIFEST_INVALID`. Migrations 35 / 0035 / no 0036; hash set unchanged. Protected paths untouched.

## Current handoff — T14E import factory development complete on feature branch; PR open, NOT merged (2026-09-17)

- **Implementation state:** `packages/recipes/src/import/{types,schema,parse,identity,ingredients,normalize,duplicates,
  sql-render,release-manifest,compiler,index}.ts` + `catalog-release.current.json`; `packages/recipes/src/catalog-fingerprint.ts`
  (extracted, re-exported); `recipe-authority.ts` readiness now takes a release manifest (default = shipped manifest) and
  `D1RecipeAuthority` a release supplier; `scripts/recipe-import.mjs` + `recipe-import-output-policy.mjs`; `pnpm recipe:import:check`;
  tests + fixtures listed in `recipe-catalog/T14E_NEXT_HANDOFF.md`; ADR-027; design doc. Migrations 35 / tip 0035 / no 0036;
  0001–0035 byte-identical (hash set unchanged). `ALL_RECIPES` = 71. Worker router, D1 reader, hydrator, Inventory Truth untouched.
- **Executed checks:** `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm recipe:seed:check` (3× ok), `pnpm recipe:import:check` (ok,
  `rel-1a047444a3632771`, 71/0), `pnpm check:migrations` (`migration-smoke=ok`), `pnpm build`, `pnpm test` **168 files /
  3878 tests PASS** (baseline 164/3818); focused: import factory 16, scale 4 (500/2000/5000), output policy + CLI 25, release
  readiness 15, updated T14D authority 17; `git diff --check` clean. Synthetic 500/2000/5000 SQL ≈ 0.78/3.1/7.9 MB.
- **Behavioural equivalence:** T14D negative controls now report `LEGACY_BASELINE_DRIFT` for a legacy field change (was
  `FINGERPRINT_DRIFT`); `ready` readiness carries `releaseId`. Everything else identical; client bundle unchanged.
- **Not done — by design:** 0036, real recipe growth, media population, any production/Cloudflare action, authority activation,
  T14F. Production remains `4ed98514…` / D1 0034 / static (operator dispatch pending per `T14CD_PRODUCTION_ROLLOUT_HANDOFF.md`).
- **Next action:** independent review of the T14E PR (do not merge automatically) → merge → record `T14E_FINAL_CANONICAL_MAIN`
  → T14F only per `recipe-catalog/T14E_NEXT_HANDOFF.md`.

## Current handoff — T14C/T14D OPS workflow merged (main 6910a7b4…); production D1/Worker untouched; operator dispatch required (2026-09-17)

- **Implementation state:** OPS-only. `.github/workflows/production-d1-migrate.yml`, `scripts/d1-migration-check.mjs`,
  `tests/unit/d1-migration-check.test.mjs`, `scripts/d1-schema-gate.sql` (5-branch), `DEPLOYMENT.md`, `docs/D1_SCHEMA_GATE.md`
  via PR #21 → `6910a7b4aee875f061454528daf6b4f0777e7f1a`. `deploy.yml`, migrations 0001–0035, `src/`, `packages/`, wrangler
  configs unchanged. Production Worker `4ed98514…`, production D1 expected tip 0034 (not read this session), recipe mode static.
- **Executed checks:** `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm check:migrations` (`migration-smoke=ok`), `pnpm build`, `pnpm test`
  **164 files / 3818 tests PASS**; real-repo candidate gate dry run at `ed34c6b9…` (35 migrations, tip 0035, 34 pins, `ref=main`
  rejected); full local-D1 rehearsal 0034→0035 (pre-ledger 34/apply, baseline 71/59/12 · 385/341/71/385, plan exactly 0035, post
  35/0035, `recipe_media` 71/71/0, FK `[]`, `quick_check ok`, drift none, schema gate PASS; certify mode with empty plan OK);
  schema-gate negative test (missing index + trigger → exit 1); 6-term gate reproduces `too many terms in compound SELECT` on local D1;
  hosted validate SUCCESS on PR head `2c39e484…` (35168307081) and on main `6910a7b4…` (35168563076); auto staging Deploy
  35168741683 SUCCESS with readiness `commit=6910a7b4…`; read-only prod probes (ready `4ed98514…`, recipes 71/59/12, media route 401
  on old Worker).
- **Not executed:** production ledger read, Time Travel bookmark, 0035 apply, production deploy, post-deploy smoke — all require the
  GitHub Actions production Environment, which needs a `workflow_dispatch` the Hoplite toolset cannot issue (sandbox `gh`
  unauthenticated; API 401). Reported as missing tooling.
- **Limitations:** `PRAGMA integrity_check` unsupported on hosted D1 (workflow uses `quick_check` + FK); `d1 info` may need extra
  token scope (workflow falls back to `d1 list` identity and warns); `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING` pre-existing; Wrangler 3.114.17.
- **Next action:** operator dispatches `Production D1 Migration` (ref `6910a7b4…`, `0034_global_recipe_catalog_parity.sql`,
  `0035_recipe_media_layer.sql`, confirm=true) and approves the production Environment; on PASS dispatch `Deploy`
  (production, ref `6910a7b4…`, hardened `bb504cce…`, confirm_production=true); then smoke + write `T14C_FINAL_COMPLETION.md` /
  `T14D_PRODUCTION_DEPLOY_RECEIPT.md` per `recipe-catalog/T14CD_PRODUCTION_ROLLOUT_HANDOFF.md`. Do NOT set `RECIPE_CATALOG_MODE`.

## Current handoff — T14D merged and certified on main (bb504cce…); production rollout deferred to OPS

- **Done this packet:** fresh pre-merge gates (main/PR head unchanged; diff within T14D scope; migrations 35 / no 0036 /
  0001–0035 unchanged; modes + fence + no user-controlled mode; readiness codes; canary determinism; Inventory Truth
  files untouched; legacy recipe FK anchors pre-existing); PR #19 merged (`MERGE_SHA=bb504cce…`, PR head in main,
  tree preserved); post-merge main certified locally (seed 3×ok, typecheck, lint, `migration-smoke=ok`, build,
  **163 files / 3801 tests**, focused 131, diff-check clean) and by hosted CI (35157739716 / 105001075798 SUCCESS);
  incidental auto-staging Deploy 35158032832 SUCCESS (staging only). Docs closure: `T14D_MERGE_RECEIPT.md`,
  `T14D_NEXT_HANDOFF.md`, state docs.
- **Not done — by design:** Cloudflare login, 0035 production apply, any deploy, enabling shadow/canary/d1, T14E,
  media population. Production remains `4ed98514…` / 0034 / static.
- **Next action:** freeze `T14D_FINAL_CANONICAL_MAIN` (docs-closure merge SHA, exact-head CI green) as the only base
  for the next task; choose a track from `recipe-catalog/T14D_NEXT_HANDOFF.md` §6 (A: T14E import factory, B: media
  population, C: other) or run the Codex OPS sequence (§4) when Cloudflare access is available.

## Previous handoff — T14D recipe authority cutover architecture, development complete pending review

- **Branch/base:** `feat/t14d-recipe-authority-cutover` from `d0856b48e043c72d1793002e7c6047a186ac890d` (exact
  `origin/main` at start). Final head/PR/CI receipt: PR body + post-publication comment.
- **Implementation:** `packages/recipes/src/recipe-authority.ts`; `src/worker/services/recipe-authority.ts`;
  `src/worker/services/recipe-catalog-shadow.ts` (mode parser delegated; shadow unchanged); `src/worker/config/validation.ts`
  (fence/percent validation); `src/worker/types.ts`; routes `recipes.ts`, `week.ts`, `shopping.ts`;
  `packages/domain/src/week/planner.ts` (no hidden static default). Tests: `tests/unit/recipe-authority.test.ts`,
  `tests/unit/recipe-catalog-authority.test.ts` (reader guard), `tests/integration/recipe-authority-routing.test.ts`.
- **Database state:** no schema change; local replay still 35 migrations; production D1 remains 0034 (0035 pending OPS).
- **Checks executed:** `pnpm recipe:seed:check`, `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm check:migrations`, `pnpm build`,
  focused suites, full `pnpm test`, `git diff --check` — exact totals in the PR body.
- **Limitations:** no Cloudflare action by design; production remains static; canary/d1 exercised only against the
  in-memory D1 harness. Readiness requires exact D1 == ALL_RECIPES parity (T14E growth needs a new policy).
- **Next action:** independent review → merge → Codex OPS: apply 0035, deploy static, then config-only progression
  `shadow → canary (fenced, small %) → d1` per `recipe-catalog/T14D_RECIPE_AUTHORITY_CUTOVER.md` §12. Do NOT enable
  canary/d1 in production without `RECIPE_CATALOG_CUTOVER_ENABLED=true` and operator approval. T14E / media population not started.

## Current handoff — T14C merged (main 3a1e6be6…); production 0035 apply + deploy pending operator credentials

- **Done this session:** fresh pre-merge gates (main/PR head unchanged, migrations 35/no 0036/0001–0034 drift 0,
  ready-integrity + storage-key gates, protected areas untouched); PR #17 merged (`MERGE_SHA=3a1e6be6…`,
  PR head in main, tree preserved); post-merge main certified locally (seed check 3× ok, typecheck, lint,
  `migration-smoke=ok`, build, **161 files / 3776 tests**, diff-check clean) and by hosted CI
  (run 35147336385 / check 104966628291 SUCCESS); automatic staging Deploy run 35147682739 SUCCESS.
- **Not done — blocked:** production D1 ledger read, backup, `0035` apply, production deploy, production smoke.
  `wrangler whoami` → not authenticated and no `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` in the sandbox; the packet's stop
  condition (Cloudflare identity cannot be proven) applies. Nothing in production was mutated.
- **Next action (operator with Cloudflare access):** follow the 10-step runbook in
  `recipe-catalog/T14C_MERGE_RECEIPT.md` — identity → ledger (expect 34 / tip 0034) → export backup →
  aggregate baseline → plan (exactly 0035) → apply → verify 71 pending / 0 ready, FK/quick_check, schema gate →
  dispatch `Deploy` for `3a1e6be6…` (production, confirm_production, approval) → smoke → write
  `T14C_FINAL_COMPLETION.md` + `T14C_NEXT_HANDOFF.md`, mark `T14C_COMPLETE`, freeze final main.
  Do NOT deploy before 0035 is applied; do NOT populate media; do NOT start T14D/T14E.

## Previous handoff — T14C Recipe Media Layer, development complete pending review

- **Branch/base:** `feat/t14c-recipe-media-layer` from `8d3ebc444bbaa577893dd88a9d21f308a24f0cf5`
  (exact `origin/main` at start; unchanged). Final head/PR/CI receipt: see the PR body and the
  post-publication comment; not embeddable here (a handoff cannot contain its own commit).
- **Implementation:** `migrations/0035_recipe_media_layer.sql`; `packages/recipes/src/recipe-media.ts`;
  `packages/db/src/recipe-media.ts`; `src/worker/routes/recipe-media.ts`; `src/worker/services/recipe-media.ts`;
  `src/worker/routes/recipes.ts` (post-ranking enrichment only); `src/worker/index.ts` (public mount);
  `src/web/lib/recipe-media.ts` + 7 surfaces; `scripts/d1-schema-gate.{sql,sh}`, `scripts/migration-smoke.sh`,
  `scripts/render-recipe-seed.mjs` (media render/check); `tests/fixtures/migration-sha256.json` (0034 pinned).
- **Database state:** local fresh replay 0001→0035 = 35 migrations, `recipe_media` 71 pending hero
  slots, 0 ready; production untouched at 0034.
- **Checks executed:** `pnpm recipe:seed:check` (3× ok), `pnpm check:migrations` (`migration-smoke=ok`,
  incl. 0034→0035 upgrade + idempotent re-read), `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm build`,
  focused Vitest (schema 10 / catalog 16 / route+API 27 / presentation 8), full `pnpm test`,
  `git diff --check` — exact totals recorded in the PR body.
- **Limitations:** no production/staging execution; no R2 objects exist (all 71 resolve to legacy
  images exactly as before); `PRAGMA integrity_check` unavailable on hosted D1 (local only).
- **Independent-review remediation (2026-09-16, forward commit on the same branch):** P1 READY_INTEGRITY —
  `promoteRecipeMediaVersion(db, images, …)` verifies the actual R2 object (existence / MIME / size /
  SHA-256 of bytes, bounded 16 MiB) before an atomic guarded D1 batch; typed `OBJECT_*` errors; failure
  keeps target pending and old ready intact. P2 STORAGE_KEY_SQL_CONTRACT — 0035 renderer regenerated:
  exact `storage_key` CHECK (`CASE mime_type`), `content_length NOT NULL` for ready. Tests:
  `tests/helpers/recipe-media-r2.ts` (realistic R2 double), schema 13 / catalog 24 / route 27 /
  presentation 8. Checks re-executed: `recipe:seed:check`, `typecheck`, `lint`, `check:migrations`,
  `build`, full `pnpm test`, `git diff --check` — totals in the PR body. Still no production/staging
  action; 0001–0034 byte-identical; no 0036.
- **Next action:** independent review of the remediated PR #17 → merge → operator rollout (backup, apply
  0035, deploy via `deploy.yml`, smoke) → separate media population task (new bytes ⇒ new version ⇒ new
  key; never overwrite a ready key). Do NOT apply 0035 remotely before review.

# Frigo / Takosan current handoff — 2026-09-15

## Current handoff — T14B-B COMPLETE; T14C ready to start, 2026-09-16

- **Implementation state:** no application code changed; this checkpoint is OPS + docs. Production D1
  ledger tip `0034`; production Worker `56979cb5-e1a8-4241-8a4c-2432d41cc439` = main `4ed98514…`.
- **Executed checks (hosted/production):** `wrangler whoami`; `d1 list/info`; ledger SELECTs before/after;
  `d1 export` (SHA-256 `ab082dd4…343c`); `d1 migrations apply --remote` (0034 ✅); catalog/ordinal/FK/
  quick_check SQL; `scripts/d1-schema-gate.sh remote` PASS; Deploy runs 35101845374 + 35102115354 SUCCESS
  (production job ran lint/typecheck/test/check:migrations/build + schema gate + smoke on the runner);
  curl smoke of health/ready/recipes/auth-config/CORS/SPA; `wrangler tail` 25 s: 0 exceptions.
- **Not executed locally in this session:** `pnpm check` (docs-only change; hosted `validate` on the PR head
  is the gate). `PRAGMA integrity_check` is refused by hosted D1 (SQLITE_AUTH) — recorded.
- **Limitations:** backup lives in the thread sandbox (`/tmp/d1-backup/…`), copy out if retention needed;
  `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING` readiness warning pre-exists; Wrangler 3.x outdated.
- **Next action:** merge this docs-only PR → freeze `T14C_CANONICAL_BASE_MAIN` = resulting main SHA →
  start T14C on `feat/t14c-recipe-media-layer` per `recipe-catalog/T14C_HANDOFF.md`. Do not enable
  `RECIPE_CATALOG_MODE=shadow` in production without a separate decision.

## Current handoff — T14B-B MERGED to main; production rollout blocked by existing OPS secret, 2026-09-16

- PR #14 (head `004e5a32`) merged into `main` as `c7455160bfc8d279d38bc7ca4c0751542012a3c5` (normal
  merge commit; PR content byte-identical in main). Main CI `validate` SUCCESS (run 35072991882);
  fresh main gates: typecheck, lint, seed check, `migration-smoke=ok`, build, 157 files / 3704 tests.
- Production D1 (`frigo-db`, `f975ec39-…`) still needs 0034 applied by an operator with Cloudflare
  credentials (none available here); the auto Deploy run 35073197948 failed at "Deploy to Cloudflare
  staging" with `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` missing — the known OPS blocker. Production application is
  unchanged (pre-T14B-B lineage). Read-only prod probe healthy (71 static recipes served).
- Status: `T14B_B_ROLLOUT_BLOCKED`; T14C NOT started (no handoff written until rollout closes).
  Receipt: `recipe-catalog/T14B_B_MERGE_RECEIPT.md`. Next: operator applies 0034 remotely, verifies
  ledger/counts/integrity, sets the staging/production Cloudflare secrets, dispatches Deploy.

## Historical — T14B-B remediation FINAL (review-ready), 2026-09-16

- Continued from safe checkpoint `d9130b69…` (hosted validate SUCCESS run 35053041994, now
  historical). Commit A `19b144a5` rewrites `tests/integration/recipe-d1-runtime-parity.test.ts`
  to consume `D1RuntimeRecipeCatalog.listRuntimeRecipes()` as emitted (no `byId`/`ALL_RECIPES`
  re-mapping, no sorting): strict-equal list + unsorted ID order, recommendation parity,
  tie-sensitive ranking, planner tie fixture, >5-alternative swap regression, executed swap,
  ingredient-ordinal integrity and shadow health (info at 0 order drift, warn otherwise), each with
  a reversed-catalog negative control. Mutation check: an ID-sorting hydrator fails 8/11 tests.
  Commit B finalises docs: category = typed open (non-empty string), region = closed vocabulary;
  ADR-024 records persisted runtime order, explicit ingredient ordinals and static authority.
- Focused: `recipe-d1-parity` 12, `recipe-d1-runtime-parity` 11, `recipe-catalog-authority` 5,
  `recipe-catalog-safety` 6 → 4 files / 34 tests. Full gates and fresh exact-head hosted CI are
  recorded in `recipe-catalog/T14B_B_REMEDIATION_HANDOFF.md` §10 and the PR #14 body.
- Authority unchanged: `ALL_RECIPES`; no `d1` mode; production static; shadow throttle unchanged;
  0001–0033 byte-identical; 0034 re-rendered in place (unmerged). PR #14 NOT merged; PR #4
  untouched; T14C/T14D/T14E not started. Next action: maintainer review + protected merge of #14.

## Historical — T14B-B remediation SAFE STOP, 2026-09-16

- Work stopped by instruction mid-remediation; nothing discarded, checkpoint pushed to PR #14's
  branch only. Superseded by the FINAL entry above; kept for lineage:
  `recipe-catalog/T14B_B_REMEDIATION_HANDOFF.md`.
- Implemented and locally verified on the checkpoint tree: persisted canonical `runtime_order`
  (0034, renderer-owned), explicit `recipe_runtime_ingredient_order` positions (reader/hydrator,
  fail-closed), `StaticRuntimeRecipeCatalog` preserves input order, shadow `orderDrift`
  diagnostics, and the 33/33 migration fingerprint manifest pinned from `c1c1c14a…`.
- Not finished: rewrite `tests/integration/recipe-d1-runtime-parity.test.ts` without the
  ALL_RECIPES-reordering workaround (tie + >5-alternative swap tests), correct category wording
  (typed open, not closed) in ADR-024/PR body, rerun full gates, obtain fresh exact-head CI.
- Tree at stop: typecheck/lint/seed-check/migration-smoke/build/full test (157 files / 3699
  tests) all exit 0; `git diff --check` clean; hosted CI on the checkpoint SHA NOT_RUN; last
  known green head `f8813d50…` (run 35050720485).
- Authority unchanged: `ALL_RECIPES`; no `d1` mode; production static; no deploy/production
  mutation. PR #14 and PR #4 remain unmerged. Do not start T14C/T14D/T14E.

  the rerun on `0284a96c` is recorded in the PR.
- Migration: `0034_global_recipe_catalog_parity.sql`; `0001–0033` hash drift NONE; fresh replay
  and populated-0033 upgrade (FK stub + cooked meal) pass in tests and `pnpm check:migrations`.
- Checks executed (this head): `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, `pnpm recipe:seed:check` (0006 +
  0034 ok), `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm check:migrations` (`migration-smoke=ok`),
  `pnpm build`, `pnpm test` → **157 files / 3697 tests passed**, `git diff --check` clean.
  Focused: `recipe-d1-parity` 10/10, `recipe-d1-runtime-parity` 6/6, `recipe-catalog-authority`
  5/5, `recipe-catalog-safety` 6/6. Remote schema gate not run (no credentials; not required).
- Truth: static 71 (59+12); D1 71 complete, staticOnly `[]`, d1Only `[]`, all drift `[]`;
  nutrition `legacy_compatibility`; category/region `typed_runtime_field`; media legacy compat only.
- Authority: `ALL_RECIPES` on every route/web/planner path (static guard test); shadow mode is
  opt-in, off-response, production-rejected; no `d1` mode.
- Not done / deferred: T14C media, T14D cutover, T14E bulk import; PR #4 untouched
  (`CLOSE_ARCHIVE` recommended); Deploy staging token blocker remains an OPS issue.
- Next action: maintainer review of PR #14 (ADR-024, `recipe-catalog/T14B_B_D1_PARITY_SHADOW.md`)
  with exact-head hosted `validate` green, then normal protected merge. Do not enable shadow in
  production or deploy. T14C/T14D/T14E remain separate packets.

## Current handoff — T14 integration refresh, 2026-09-15 UTC

- Task: reconcile T14A then accepted T14B-A; no redesign or T14B-B.
- Repository: `vn-clo/Frigo-dev`, ID `1368281478`; verified canonical main before
  this docs-only receipt `a165474a623a8130c9a9ed4f1df096b3ac3b3ae9`.
- Merges: T14A PR #11 → `fbd14c771070e1b5594532648d79fb60c891747d`, then
  T14B-A PR #12 → `a165474a623a8130c9a9ed4f1df096b3ac3b3ae9`. Normal protected
  flow, no history rewrite. Source PRs #7/#8 remain historical references.
- Branch: docs-only final merge receipt from both completed integrations.
- Output: historical audit retained with explicit lineage refresh; current
  production truth wins over old shared-status prose. Detailed receipt:
  `recipe-catalog/T14_INTEGRATION_REFRESH.md`.
- Production: PR #9 merge `911db7fdddcd60ea1e3f3c17b4aed3f4b922bda5`, Worker
  `20bc1f35-6ffe-4085-ba79-d54a0b53da71` recorded at 100%; PR #10 receipt
  adds docs only. No fresh deploy or production probe was performed here.
- Checks: fresh frozen install, lint, typecheck, test (**151 files / 3633 tests**),
  migration smoke, build and diff check all exit 0. All 33 migration hashes match;
  T14A application-path diff is empty. Exact T14A hosted head `e916d292` passed
  run `35034318031`. T14B-A exact head `3e393741` passed hosted run `35035112092`
  and every fresh required local gate: 154 files / 3676 tests, seed check/render,
  typecheck, lint, migration smoke, build, diff check; post-run tree empty.
- Blockers: Deploy `35035612637` staging lacks `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`; release
  succeeded, production skipped. Main CI `35035415271` passed. Do not fix secrets.
- Safety: migrations 0001–0033, static `ALL_RECIPES` authority, Inventory Truth,
  Qwen, PayOS and PR #9 headers/source remain unchanged; media deferred to T14C.
  PR #4 remains open with CLOSE_ARCHIVE recommendation, not merge.
- Architecture: accepted safety modules remain non-authoritative. Recipe ADR-023
  only renumbers the historical ADR-022 to preserve PR #9's Auth/OCR decision.
- Recipe truth: 71/59/12 runtime; fresh local D1 replay complete 59, static-only
  globals 12, d1-only/incomplete/rejected empty, supported-field drift zero;
  nutrition unsupported, not fabricated parity. Renderer containment intact.
- Next action: finish the protected docs-only receipt. Its post-merge PR comment
  records exact final main / `T14B_B_BASE_MAIN` and final CI/Deploy status (a commit
  cannot embed its own eventual merge SHA). Then use that final main for a
  separately authorized T14B-B packet. **READY_FOR_T14B_B** prerequisites only.
  **T14B-B NOT STARTED; do not create 0034 or deploy.**

# Historical handoffs — not current next-action authority

Retained verbatim below; old main/production SHAs and unfinished-task statements
describe their original checkpoints, not the current refresh above.

## Auth/OCR production hardening handoff — 2026-09-16

Branch: `codex/auth-ocr-production-fix`.

The live auth error was traced to a frontend-only credential-less Google fallback
that sent `userInfo` without an ID token; it is removed. GIS initialization now
waits for the async SDK and provides a safe retry state. A shared
`ScanProcessingState` gives the upload, fridge review and receipt review screens
visible pending stages and elapsed-time reassurance while preserving the server
status contract and review-before-confirm rule.

Checks executed: focused auth/OCR `54/54`; full Vitest `3632/3632` (151 files);
`pnpm lint`; `pnpm typecheck`; `pnpm check:migrations`; `pnpm build`; and
`git diff --check` all passed. Known test stderr is expected injected failure or
KV-degraded limiter logging; no test failed.

No deployment, remote D1 migration, secret/configuration mutation, production
KV/R2/queue mutation, PayOS change or T14 work occurred. Next action is exact
branch browser smoke and PR/hosted-CI review. Do not deploy from this branch
until those gates pass and an explicit maintainer release decision exists.

## Production rollout handoff — 2026-09-15

Production is serving canonical Worker SHA
`e6b91956484589c088e6d04a9835b3e59a2eb786` after compatibility Worker
`64ee9ed1d986a5e521598a36656e9c2f59d682ee` was deployed ahead of the remote
bridge. D1 `frigo-db` has ledger `0001`-`0033`; `pnpm schema:check:remote`
passed. Readiness returned HTTP 200 with exact canonical commit, database and
queue healthy, AI/configured, and only the known PLUS-grant warning.

Evidence: export `/tmp/frigo-prod-pre0032-20260916.sql`, SHA-256
`378c023b15c159d140162e6eb74bbf2ad584e7b699c72384379119defe6dec6a`; health,
recipes, manifest/Takosan assets and unauthenticated mutation checks passed;
full local Vitest was `3630/3630`, frozen install/lint/typecheck/build passed.
Ad-hoc Cloudflare SQL queries were denied with `SQLITE_AUTH`, so rely on the
repository-owned schema gate rather than claiming direct PRAGMA evidence.

Open follow-up: PR #4 (`release/pre0032-schema-compat`, commit `64ee9ed1`) is
still open with no hosted checks. Do not bypass branch protection; obtain CI
and maintainer review, then merge it history-preservingly so production and
canonical `main` converge. No PayOS, DNS, secret rotation, KV/R2/queue data
mutation or T14 work was performed.

## Current canonical repository handoff

- Repository: `vn-dlo/Frigo-dev` (ID `1368281478`).
- Application freeze: `5f6853d0ed11415871dca0fd31d4981d60518310`.
- Historical superseded candidate: `e34ed16777166407acf67b2c76d733d89c7d64ca`.
- Merged PR: #2, base `main`, head `canonical/5f6853d-promotion-ci`.
- Final reviewed head: `7ede92c73a41da24500746fd0eded892689d8558`.
- Final canonical main: `a5cfb14cfd5840be23eb16b26a3689f5e2d6e805`.
- Exact PR CI: run `34972891435`, `validate` PASS.
- Post-merge main CI: run `34973522150`, `validate` PASS.
- Protection: strict `validate`, admin enforcement, force-push and branch
  deletion blocked; approval count zero under the recorded waiver.

PR #2 used a history-preserving merge commit. Its tree is identical to reviewed
head `7ede92c`, and production, Qwen, T13, Takosan and application-freeze SHAs
remain ancestors of canonical `main`. Current required action is only to publish
this docs-only post-merge receipt. Do not modify application code, deploy,
migrate production, touch production resources or start T14.

Maintainer decision: external technical review is accepted for this
consolidation at final reviewed head `7ede92c73a41da24500746fd0eded892689d8558`
(P0=0, P1=0, P2=0). The GitHub-native collaborator approval may be waived by
the owner; do not fabricate or impersonate a GitHub review. All other branch
protections and exact-head CI gates remain required.

Production deployment is complete under the separate rollout receipt above.
The automatic post-merge Deploy workflow had skipped production earlier; the
operator-authorized rollout later applied the bridge migrations and deployed
the exact canonical SHA. PR #4 is the remaining canonicalization follow-up.

# Historical production integration handoff — 2026-09-15

## Historical safe-merger planning handoff — superseded as current authority

Status: **PROMOTION BRANCH PUBLISHED; PR OPEN; MERGE/RELEASE BLOCKED ON HOSTED CI, ADMIN CONTROLS AND ROLLING COMPATIBILITY**.

The decision-complete repository-promotion plan is
`docs/integration/CANONICAL_REPOSITORY_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md`; production
rollout sequencing remains in `docs/integration/SAFE_PRODUCTION_MERGER_PLAN.md`.
Verified access is production
`ADMIN` and Frigo-dev `WRITE`; fetched default heads remain `05423f2` and
`d1b0673`; common base is `d1b0673`. Production already contains the adapted
frontend and platform upgrades through `d270cd4`/`57c88c5` and `3f33d11`, so
their historical branch tips must not be reapplied.
Qwen source `da41686` is not in production `main`; it is 15 commits ahead and
must remain an explicit frozen merge source.

Promotion receipt: branch `canonical/5f6853d-promotion` is
`f48e830ed9cdde2214ad5b4dbd58b8bc30c06106`; archive pointer
`archive/pre-canonical-consolidation` is `d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`;
PR #1 targets `main`. Local frozen install, lint, typecheck, migration smoke,
build, Vitest `3630/3630`, D1 `92/92`, browser `60/60`, and diff check passed.
Hosted exact-head CI has not reported. Branch protection is 404 and current
account is not admin. Do not merge.

Migration audit found exactly one semantic numbering collision: production
`0023_scan_request_fingerprint.sql` (`777f4b6f...`) versus dev
`0023_inventory_truth_foundation.sql` (`1ec671af...`). Canonical resolution is
production `0001`-`0023` unchanged plus certified T08-T13 at `0024`-`0033`.
However canonical `0032` adds a trigger that rejects the current production
Worker's `is_confirmed = 1`-only confirmation update, while the integrated
Worker assumes the new columns exist. Next action is a separately reviewed
schema-capability compatibility release and pre/post-0032 rolling rehearsal,
not a production merge or migration. Release the compatibility Worker
independently from `05423f2`, then run separate Qwen/runtime, T08-T13 bridge and
Takosan brand-only trains, each from the prior deployed production head. Do not
promote current `f26003b` directly. No remote state was changed in this audit.

Executed checks: repository/API permissions; branch heads, merge-base,
ancestry and source diff counts; all-fetched-ref migration scan; bridge/source
blob comparison; scan SQL inspection; pre/post-0032 SQLite failure probes; and
`git diff --check` (PASS). Both probes exited `1` with the expected errors. No
application suite was rerun because this continuation changed docs only.

## Historical candidate remediation handoff — superseded

Status: **INDEPENDENT-REVIEW REMEDIATION COMPLETE AND COMMITTED LOCALLY**.

`WORKING_BRANCH=integration/t13-takosan-qwen`

`PRODUCTION_BASE=05423f2ad675006a4c7913e696f1979b3fcaae59`

`COMMON_BASE=d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`

`REVIEWED_CANDIDATE_SUPERSEDED=e34ed16777166407acf67b2c76d733d89c7d64ca`

`REMEDIATION_BASE_HEAD=231d1e76e0320133e047624eea2be546ff779bd6`

`REMEDIATION_COMMIT=5f6853d`

`INTEGRATION_DOCS_HEAD=c14116e3f979f90ca42ec21187c1aa55d319185b`

The integration line combines production Qwen `da41686b`, certified T13 `32ddbb4`
(review `9c3c3d3`), hardened Takosan `ff63edf`, and byte-identical T13 migrations
renumbered to `0024`-`0033`. Production migration changes `0`, bridge mismatches
`0`, unknown inventory writers/readers `0/0`. Frozen install, lint, typecheck,
migration smoke, build, full Vitest `3628/3628` (149), real local D1 `92/92` (5),
and browser `60/60` (360/390/430, serial, last) historically passed before
review. The remediation restores protected payment UI to production base,
replaces the mocked-router integration proof with real Qwen runtime composition,
retains exact missing/0/.11/.9 evidence, preserves concrete runtime errors, and
scopes Takosan tests away from payment. Auth intentionally retains certified
T13 DEC-012 guest-transfer deferral. P3-1/P3-2 remain unchanged.

Fresh remediation receipt: focused `41/41`; affected matrix first `300/302`
(two brand assertions incorrectly included payment), corrected brand `16/16`;
full Vitest `3630/3630` in 149 files; lint, typecheck, migration smoke, build and
diff check PASS; browser `60/60` at 360/390/430 PASS.
Two intermediate typecheck attempts failed on incorrect `fetch` spy annotation
forms; the final `MockInstance<typeof globalThis.fetch>` annotation passes, as
does the post-fix focused `57/57` run.

Access preflight is READY: current GitHub account has `ADMIN` on
`Tungjpstore/Frigo` and `WRITE` on `vn-dlo/Frigo-dev`; default heads remain
`05423f2`/`d1b0673`, and neither repo reports protection/rulesets. Local
`origin=Tungjpstore/yaji`, so do not use an implicit `git push origin`.

**NO HOSTED GITHUB CI STATUS FOR INTEGRATION_APPLICATION_CANDIDATE**.

Next: independently review immutable remediation SHA `5f6853d`. No PR, push,
merge, deploy, remote migration/resource
mutation, PayOS/payment work, secret/DNS change, or T14. Exact evidence and
retained setup failures are in `docs/integration/`.

# Takosan brand handoff — 2026-09-14 (independent of the T13 handoff below)

Task: user-facing brand migration Frigo → Takosan from the supplied brand kit.
Status: **TAKOSAN BRAND MIGRATION COMPLETE — READY FOR BRAND REVIEW.**
Branch `hoplite/megara-hyblaia-6b723eb2` (Hoplite broker branch; preferred name
`feat/takosan-brand-refresh` could not be published by the broker), base
`TAKOSAN_BRAND_BASE=897102b6816c22af2e6a49f29662690e3e3206e0`,
`TAKOSAN_BRAND_APPLICATION_CHECKPOINT=e37ee2808a50a7195dc90a2e7bb01be639aa186b`;
the docs-only commit containing this section is `TAKOSAN_BRAND_DOCS_HEAD`.
T13 freeze `32ddbb4`, `42e0037`, `897102b`, main `d1b0673` unchanged.

Exact checks at `e37ee28`: `git diff --check` clean; `pnpm typecheck` PASS;
`pnpm exec eslint src/web tests/unit/takosan-brand.test.tsx scripts/generate-takosan-icons.mjs`
PASS; `pnpm build` PASS; `CI=1 pnpm test` **3480 passed / 139 files**;
`CI=1 pnpm test:browser` **60 passed / 60** (4.0 m); Playwright brand QA matrix
360/390/430 × landing/onboarding/auth/home/fridge/scan/planner/profile: 0 broken
asset requests, 0 horizontal overflow. Failures: none.

Next action: brand review of `e37ee28`; then optionally delete legacy Frigo brand
assets under `public/frigo/{brand,app-icons,illustrations}`. Do not merge to main,
deploy, touch remote D1 or PayOS. Full details in
[docs/brand/TAKOSAN_MIGRATION.md](../brand/TAKOSAN_MIGRATION.md).

# Frigo AI Handoff — T13R certified, ready for independent review #2

## Current handoff — T13R certified freeze, 2026-09-14

Task: final technical certification of the fully remediated T13 candidate
(T13R-A + T13R-B), exact application freeze, detached recertification, docs.
Status: **T13 REMEDIATION CERTIFIED — READY FOR INDEPENDENT FINAL REVIEW #2.**
Repository `vn-blo/Frigo-dev` (owner renamed from `vn-co3`; ID **1368281478**
verified via public API). Branch `hoplite/delos-f0bb1d04` — this thread's only
broker-authorized branch; it fast-forwards from `origin/hoplite/medma-164548ce`
(`83248df4f97d2110527a69e92a3ebe162aa71492`, the T13R-B safe-stop docs head, which
is itself docs-only above the T13R-B candidate `7e68e3b358f73786cc02eaa7db24537df855fba5`).

**T13R_APPLICATION_FREEZE = `32ddbb4f2bb636fdcf201e9ca99c4689d3655477`**, published
via the trusted broker and fetch-verified (`origin/hoplite/delos-f0bb1d04 ==
32ddbb4`). The docs-only commit that follows this handoff is `T13R_DOCS_HEAD`; its
explicit application-path diff against the freeze must be EMPTY. Main
`d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa` unchanged. Rejected freeze
`7b7bb695ee597a46cf4022a2c534e2fea374be5d` unchanged, **DO NOT RELEASE**.

Why `7e68e3b` is not the freeze: certification required two test/fixture-only
changes. `bd2f5f3` — the T13R-B openedAt fixture seeded a `FRESH_MILK` 'Sữa tươi'
row that fridge confirmation grouped browser case C into (**3 failed / 51 passed**
first full serial run); the fixture now seeds `preview-stock-cheese`. `32ddbb4` —
new `tests/e2e/t13r-a-expiry-reopen.e2e.ts` because the packet requires browser
coverage of the explicit-expiry reopen (previously jsdom-only); RED at `7b7bb69`,
GREEN 6/6. Application source, migrations, dependencies and harness config are
byte-identical to `7e68e3b` (explicit path diff EMPTY).

Exact checks — pre-freeze (development worktree, `CI=1`, Vitest before browser)
and clean detached (`git worktree add --detach /tmp/t13r-freeze 32ddbb4`, frozen

IngredientRow `/fridge` ReferenceError all CLOSED with permanent tests re-run at
the freeze; **P0 0, P1 0, blocking P2 0**. Original AC1–AC14 **all PASS**
(numbering from `release/T13_PROPOSED_SCOPE.md`); R3/R4/R5/R6/R7/R8/R11 and
U1/U4/U6/U7/U8/U12/U13/U14 **DONE**. **NO HOSTED GITHUB CI STATUS FOR
T13R_APPLICATION_FREEZE** (0 runs / 0 checks / 0 contexts; `ci.yml` triggers on
main/PR only).

Evidence (gitignored/sandbox): `.hoplite/artifacts/t13r-cert/{,prefreeze-bd2f5f3,
prefreeze-32ddbb4}/`, `/tmp/t13r-detached-logs/` (freeze), `/tmp/t13r-detached-logs-
bd2f5f3/`, drivers `/tmp/t13r-tools/`. Full record:
[T13R_FINAL_CERTIFICATION.md](inventory-truth/t13/T13R_FINAL_CERTIFICATION.md).

Limitations: all evidence is local; hosted CI absent for the exact freeze. Browser
evidence uses the repository's isolated synthetic harness (`SCAN_QUEUE_MODE` sync);
the async queue path is proven by the real queue processor over real migrations in
Vitest, not in the browser. `.hoplite/settings.json` overlay remains uncommitted.

Safety: main merged NO; production modified/deployed NO; remote D1 NO; PayOS NO;
T14 NO; repository reconciliation NO.

Publication (verified by brokered fetch after publishing): **T13R_DOCS_HEAD =
`42e0037f92104fd5dc3c89c633d91f67fa892724`** is remote on `hoplite/delos-f0bb1d04`
(`LOCAL_HEAD == REMOTE_HEAD`); freeze `32ddbb4` is its ancestor and the explicit
application-path diff `32ddbb4..42e0037` is EMPTY. `origin/main` remains
`d1b06732…`. `hoplite/medma-164548ce` stays at `83248df…` because the broker
refuses to publish to this thread's configured base branch; it is a strict
fast-forward ancestor and a maintainer may advance it without any rewrite. The
commit recording this paragraph is a later docs-only receipt on the same branch.

Next action: **INDEPENDENT T13 FINAL REVIEW #2** of exact freeze `32ddbb4` and its
docs-only head. Nothing else is authorized.

## Historical handoff — T13R-A application checkpoint, 2026-09-13 (superseded)

Task: T13R-A data-integrity & ownership remediation of the rejected T13 freeze.
Status: **T13R-A COMPLETE — READY FOR T13R-B.** Not a final T13 freeze.
Repository: `vn-co3/Frigo-dev` (owner renamed from `vn-co2`; ID **1368281478**
verified). Branch `hoplite/oropos-eb2d4886--t13r-a-data-integrity-ownership`.
Recovered this session from the mismatched local branch `hoplite/amisos-peiraieus-
ab9b6c4c`/`hoplite/medma-164548ce` (HEAD `b9735b4`, a docs-only ancestor of the
remote head) by `git switch --track`; no reset/rebase/cherry-pick/force-push.

**T13R_A_APPLICATION_CHECKPOINT=`fc0f9c56c53ae7b17f2d1fb4770a6bc231ebc027`**
(starting checkpoint `d589342cbcef9f80487a2c269bcf6133fe0e4415`). The docs-only
commit following this handoff is `T13R_A_DOCS_HEAD`; its non-doc diff against the
application checkpoint must be empty. Main `d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`
unchanged. Rejected freeze `7b7bb695ee597a46cf4022a2c534e2fea374be5d` unchanged,
**DO NOT RELEASE**.

Implemented (one finding at a time, REPRODUCE → RED permanent test → minimal fix →
GREEN → regression): **P1-1** async queue raw evidence + nullable confidence
(`4d73365`); **P2-A/P2-B** additive migration `0032_scan_evidence_completeness.sql`
(`ocr_canonical_id/category/storage`, `reviewed_expiry_date/kind` + fail-closed

**P1-2** canonical identity preserved under free-form rename (`20bc14e`);
**P1-3/P1-4** lot-keyed detail with draft-owner check and route-id-owned receipt
review (`43e95ed`); test alignment (`bb19fc0`, `fc0f9c5`). Migrations **32**;
0001–0031 byte-identical to the freeze; no backfill in 0032.

Exact checks at the checkpoint: `pnpm lint` PASS; `pnpm typecheck` PASS;
`pnpm build` PASS; `pnpm test` **3423/3423 in 137 files**; focused
`tests/{integration,unit}/t13r-a-*` **45/45 in 5 files**; real local D1 (workerd)
`*-d1.test.mjs` **92/92 in 5 files**; `bash scripts/migration-smoke.sh` ok (includes
populated 0031→0032 upgrade over legacy pending/confirmed and T13 pending/confirmed/
rejected rows, zero fabricated evidence); `wrangler d1 migrations apply frigo-db
--local` fresh 32 ✅ and legacy freeze-tree 0001–0031 + seeded rows → 0032 ✅ with
pre-existing columns byte-identical, all new columns SQL NULL, `foreign_key_check` 0;
`pnpm schema:check:local` PASS on both; `CI=1 pnpm exec playwright test`
**42 passed / 0 failed** (14 cases × 360/390/430, includes the new
`tests/e2e/t13r-a-ownership.e2e.ts`); `git diff --check` PASS.

Authority audit: inventory `INSERT/UPDATE inventory_items|inventory_lots` statement
set and T11 reader call set are identical to the freeze; the 0032 columns are read
only by `scan-evidence.ts` → `scanItemDto()`. UNKNOWN writers **0**, UNKNOWN readers
**0**. T09 write and T11 read authority preserved.

Not changed (T13R-B, still OPEN): Cloudflare fridge `vision()` confidence clamp,
inventory conflict/refetch UX, Home estimated-expiry qualifier, `openedAt === null`
→ "Chưa mở". PayOS, auth, production infra untouched. `.hoplite/settings.json`
overlay kept uncommitted.

Limitations: hosted CI was not consulted; all evidence is local. Browser evidence
uses the repository's isolated synthetic harness (SCAN_QUEUE_MODE sync); the async
path is proven by the real queue processor over real migrations in Vitest, not in
the browser.

Publication state (verified by brokered fetch after publishing): the first
T13R-A docs head `111171d373769a2037c047d678236b97c33e60d8` (application
checkpoint `fc0f9c5` + docs) is remote on **`hoplite/medma-164548ce`**, this
thread's only broker-authorized branch. Remote
`hoplite/oropos-eb2d4886--t13r-a-data-integrity-ownership` still points at the
safe-stop `d589342` because the trusted broker refuses to publish to that branch
from this thread and the sandbox has no direct Git credentials. `111171d` (and the
docs commit that records this paragraph) descend from `d589342` by fast-forward
only; a maintainer can advance the remediation branch with
`git push origin <docs-head>:hoplite/oropos-eb2d4886--t13r-a-data-integrity-ownership`
without any rewrite. Main is unchanged.

Next action: **T13R-B** on a stacked branch from this checkpoint — fix the four
deferred blockers only, red/green each, then new application freeze → independent
recertification. No merge/deploy/remote D1/PayOS/T14/repository reconciliation.
Full detail: [T13R_A_REMEDIATION.md](inventory-truth/t13/T13R_A_REMEDIATION.md).

## Historical handoff — T13R-A safe stop, 2026-09-13T15:50:34Z (superseded)

Status: **T13R-A SAFELY CHECKPOINTED — READY FOR HANDOFF** (implementation not
started). Repository `vn-co2/Frigo-dev`, ID **1368281478**. Branch
`hoplite/oropos-eb2d4886--t13r-a-data-integrity-ownership`; starting/pre-stop SHA
`b9735b441d93dfb7d7d409a47292974c8f2f1e52`. The audit commit is docs-only, descends
from docs head `4fcbc96…`, is published remotely (`hoplite/oropos-eb2d4886`,
`git ls-remote` equality verified), and is protected from amendment.

Verified before any edit: empty non-doc delta from rejected freeze `7b7bb69…`;
origin/main `d1b06732…` unchanged; migrations 31, 0031 untouched, no 0032.
Finding status: P1-1/P1-2/P1-3/P1-4/P2-A/P2-B all **NOT STARTED**;
`NO_NEW_T13R_A_CODE_COMMIT=true`. Executed: full identity gate and
`git diff --check` PASS. Not run (nothing to test): typecheck, scoped lint,
focused/full/D1/browser suites, migration replays, authority audit.

Uncommitted preserved file: `.hoplite/settings.json` (pre-existing workspace
overlay; prohibited from commit by safe-stop rules). Complete state, exact
commands and resume point:
[T13R_A_REMEDIATION.md](inventory-truth/t13/T13R_A_REMEDIATION.md).
Safety: no freeze, no main merge, no deploy, no remote D1, no PayOS, no T14, no
repository reconciliation. Next step: begin T13R-A implementation on this branch,
starting with the P1-1/P2-A evidence schema decision, one red/green finding at a
time; deferred T13R-B blockers stay open.

## Current handoff — independent final review failed, 2026-09-13

Status: **T13 INDEPENDENT FINAL REVIEW — FAIL**. No remediation was performed.
Review branch `hoplite/oropos-eb2d4886` starts at docs head
`4fcbc96b5a5d4b3cea2c2ad0bdb5682b1866891a`. The detached application freeze
`7b7bb695ee597a46cf4022a2c534e2fea374be5d` remains clean. Repository ID 1368281478
is verified under current provider name `vn-co2/Frigo-dev`; protected main and
the certified remote branch retain their required exact SHAs. Non-doc delta from
freeze to docs is empty; all 31 migration blobs retain their introducing bytes.

Fresh verification: lint/typecheck/build, **3372/132** full, **194/10** focused,
**92/5** real local D1, **36/36** browser, migration smoke, fresh local 31-migration
apply, legacy replay/upgrade, local schema and diff PASS. Existing browser suite
ran serially after source-writing tests. Hosted exact-freeze checks are absent.

Findings: **P0 0 / P1 4 / blocking P2 6 / P3 3 groups**. Independent probes
reproduced async evidence/confidence loss, U7 canonical-identity loss and cross-lot
draft submission, receipt response-ID mismatch, fabricated fridge confidence,
lost confirmed expiry, stale generic inventory conflict recovery, unqualified
Home estimates, and false unopened labels for NULL opening evidence. Raw review
field coverage and failed-refetch handling also have source evidence.

Retained diagnostic limitations: one audit input initially used the wrong version
field; its corrected focus-refetch probe remained inconclusive and is not a
finding. Home initially lacked the synthetic onboarding prerequisite; the corrected
fixture reproduced the defect. Original historical certification logs were absent;
fresh exact-freeze gates replaced, rather than authenticated, those historical runs.

Complete report, original acceptance and roadmap matrix, exact commands and
evidence: [T13_INDEPENDENT_FINAL_REVIEW.md](release/T13_INDEPENDENT_FINAL_REVIEW.md).
Only that report and required status/handoff docs changed; pre-existing
`.hoplite/settings.json` work was preserved and excluded. No PR, merge, deploy,
remote D1, PayOS application work, T14, or repository reconciliation.

Next action: **NEW T13 REMEDIATION BRANCH → confirmed blockers only → new freeze
→ independent certification**. Do not reconcile production yet. Earlier handoffs
below are historical and superseded by this failed independent review.

## Current handoff — T13 final detached certification, 2026-09-13

Task: T13B-B repository-owned browser harness → freeze → detached certification.
Status: **T13 COMPLETE — STOP for INDEPENDENT T13 FINAL REVIEW**.
Repository: `vn-ca1/Frigo-dev`, ID **1368281478**.
Main: `d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`, unchanged.
Branch: `hoplite/mende-26679a14--browser-harness-final-cert`.
Starting HEAD: `3262eaff86333da142ada1135e5a20c58ea640eb`; application fd32aa8.
Separate U7 application fix: `47b10e25d6853a9bc4f9dfcf2e83bc01ba330bf2`.
**T13B_APPLICATION_FREEZE: `7b7bb695ee597a46cf4022a2c534e2fea374be5d`**,
published/fetched equal. Final docs publication follows separately and must have
an empty non-doc delta; its exact SHA is recorded after commit creation.

Changed: Playwright 1.63/Chromium isolated harness, mobile A–I/U7/reconciliation
tests, test-only fixture controls and privacy-safe failure artifacts. A real
browser negative test identified missing U7 existing-lot metadata fields; the
separate fix adds name/unit/category to expiry/storage through existing T09 adapters.
No prior scan hardening, inventory architecture, production configuration or schema
was redesigned. HTML report output was removed after synthetic leakage proof.

Executed: full pre-freeze **3372/132**, detached **3372/132**; browser before and
after freeze **36/36** at all three widths. Detached T08 **130/2**, T09 **1259/17**,
T10 **98/6**, T11 **39/2**, T12 **22/3**, T13/T13B **271/12**; 10-file focused
**194/194** including hardening 26 and CLI 26. Real local workerd/D1 **92/5**.
Lint/typecheck/build/migration smoke/fresh local D1/legacy replay/schema/diff PASS;
new detached checkout `/tmp/frigo-t13b-detached-cert` remains clean. Writer/reader
UNKNOWN 0/0, 31 migrations, unchanged 0031, no 0032. Original AC1–AC14 PASS and all
required roadmap rows DONE. Scoped P0/P1/blocking P2/P3: 0.

Failures: first concurrent detached browser 35/36 (H document marker lost on Vite
reload from existing generator test); same freeze passed all 36 serially afterward.
No frozen file or assertion was changed. Reproduce browser only after source-writing
checks finish. Complete chronology and exact commands:
[T13B_FINAL_HARDENING.md](inventory-truth/t13/T13B_FINAL_HARDENING.md).
Hosted: **NO HOSTED GITHUB CI STATUS FOR T13B_APPLICATION_FREEZE**.

Next action: independent final review of the frozen tree, original AC matrix,
roadmap closure and docs-only delta. Do not implement further work, merge main,
deploy, access remote D1, touch PayOS, start T14, or reconcile repositories.
Earlier handoffs below are historical and superseded by this section.

## Current handoff — fresh-session Preview safe-stop, 2026-09-13

Task: resume T13B-B browser/final-certification WIP only; do not begin T14 or integration.
Status: **T13 NOT COMPLETE — BROWSER VERIFICATION BLOCKED**; no application defect was
found or reopened.
Repository: `vn-ca1/Frigo-dev`, ID **1368281478**. Main:
`d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa` (unchanged).
Branch/start: fresh thread branch `hoplite/mende-26679a14` and prior continuation
`hoplite/kos-9d39545d--t13b-b-final-certification` both started at
`a9b5904aeba0fc7e4d649165770a4e86701312a2`; initial status/diff empty.
Lineage: verified `2334a6f -> c37a9b8 -> f845d04 -> fd32aa8 -> a9b5904`, with the
`fd32aa8..a9b5904` non-doc diff empty.
Preview: effective run `node scripts/security-preview.mjs`. Three schema-valid calls
(`preview`, 120 seconds, promotion `preview:3000`) all failed before startup:
`Preview port must be a currently discovered HTTP listener owned by the managed preview run`.
Port 3000 is the harness default, but no harness listener was running; only browser
processes were listening. No settings/script change, ad-hoc server, or workaround.
Checks: workspace setup reported ready with no configured setup run. No fresh
focused/full/type/lint/build/D1/migration-replay/schema/authority checks ran; 176/9 and
26 hardening/adoption results are historical only. `CURRENT_FULL_TEST_COUNT` and
`CURRENT_FULL_FILE_COUNT` are not established. Migration integrity passed (31,
unchanged 0031, no 0032); `git diff --check` passed. Platform fault report recorded.
Not run: flows A–I, 360/390/430 checks, and real viewport-emulation capability.
Next: repair the supported managed Preview interface and resume every mandatory WIP
flow before measuring the baseline, closing AC/roadmap evidence, freezing, and clean
certification. No `T13B_APPLICATION_FREEZE` or `T13B_DOCS_HEAD`; no merge, deploy,
remote D1, PayOS, or T14 work.

## Current handoff — confirmed UX checkpoint, 2026-09-13 12:40 UTC

Task: finish T13B-B, not T14/integration/deployment.
Status: **T13 NOT COMPLETE — BROWSER VERIFICATION BLOCKED**, owner stop rule applied.
Identity: fresh verification of `vn-ca1/Frigo-dev`, ID 1368281478, historical redirect,
guarded main, old WIP branch, 2334a6f -> c37a9b8 -> f845d04 ancestry/docs-only delta.
Branch: `hoplite/kos-9d39545d--t13b-b-final-certification`, created at exact f845d04.
Published WIP: `fd32aa8deaee7df454245591015780c59f909352`, not application freeze.
Change: completed/read-only confirmed scan wording and `Xem tủ lạnh`; no confirmation
CTA/manual addition. All persisted controls disabled and previous 23 regressions retained.
Checks: 176/176 (9 files), hardening 26/26, operator 26/26, typecheck/scoped lint/diff PASS.
Failure: one fresh supported-schema Preview attempt still requires a pre-discovered
managed listener; reported platform fault. Only browser listeners exist, no isolated app.
No unsupported workaround/settings commit. Browser/mobile and final gates remain unrun.
Next: follow latest `inventory-truth/t13/T13B_B_WIP_HANDOFF.md`; unblock Preview,
verify flows A–I and widths, measure actual current full suite (not 3177/124), close
original AC/roadmap/source audit and independent diff review, then freeze/certify.
No final application/docs SHA assigned; old WIP/main preserved; no merge/deploy/remote D1/PayOS.

## Current authoritative handoff — T13B-B hardened WIP, 2026-09-13

Program: Inventory Truth Layer / T13B-B final hardening after recovery
Status: **BLOCKED_FINAL_VERIFICATION — T13 NOT COMPLETE**
Repository: `vn-ca1/Frigo-dev`, ID **1368281478**; historical `Tungjpstore/Frigo-dev`
transfer/redirect verified against that ID.
Starting WIP: `2334a6f41cf68d42ae1eba7a30440b8fe324eb31`; all specified main/rescue/
quota-WIP refs and `c31567e` ancestry passed before editing.
Branch: `hoplite/kos-9d39545d--t13b-b-final-hardening`
Published/fetched WIP: `c37a9b8d7afc66507052bbc8f1e8a24fdc896e8d`, **not a freeze**.
Changed: route-authoritative ScanResultPage, fenced polling/confirm/refetch, safe
domain errors, store-retained terminal review status, 23 permanent regressions.
Checks: final focused 173/173 (9 files), preserved backend 1122/1122 (17 files),
typecheck, scoped lint, CLI syntax and diff check PASS. Red/green diagnostic:
5 targeted cases fail against recovered WIP, all pass on continuation.
Failures resolved: missing node_modules; two incorrect test DTO TS2345 errors;
duplicate discovery of an initially nested diagnostic worktree (moved outside).
Remaining blocker: mandatory `preview_start` promotion schema rejects first startup;
reported to platform. Effective run override selects the existing isolated harness;
pre-existing settings overlay stays uncommitted. No browser/mobile proof or final
freeze/full-suite/real-D1/migration/schema/build certification was fabricated.
Migration/authority: 31 unchanged, no 0032; writer/reader UNKNOWN 0/0. Historical
`69b0dc6` is not an ancestor, but all five Part A docs were retained; no history rewrite.
Next: follow `inventory-truth/t13/T13B_B_WIP_HANDOFF.md` to unblock Preview, finish
original AC1–AC14/roadmap evidence, freeze, run clean detached gates, publish docs-only
head, then independent T13 final review. Main unchanged; no merge/deploy/remote D1/PayOS.

## Current authoritative handoff — T13B-B stopped by owner, 2026-09-13

**Quota-safe WIP; not final certification.** Read
[T13B_B_WIP_HANDOFF.md](inventory-truth/t13/T13B_B_WIP_HANDOFF.md) first.
It records the actual application-checkpoint base versus the owner's expected docs
base, all implementation/test changes, 109 passing focused tests, partial browser
evidence and the interrupted review. After initial access failures, WIP
`a8cefd13505bc6b45dd11f45a6323539deb60f93` was published/fetched with exact equality;
main was reverified unchanged. Fresh public numeric metadata still returns 404.
Preserve the checkpoint and wait for explicit permission before resuming work;
reverify identity and the documented base discrepancy first. No settings edits or
main merge. The safe-stop report records the final documentation-follow-up SHA.

## Current authoritative handoff — T13B-A backend continuation, 2026-09-13

Program: Inventory Truth Layer — T13B split continuation
Task: T13B-A BACKEND TRUTH HARDENING (Part A only)
Status: **T13B-A COMPLETE — READY FOR T13B-B**; no final T13 certification
Repository: vn-2l/frigo-dev; verified numeric ID 1364064929
Branch: hoplite/megara-hyblaia-888f1514 (platform-generated equivalent)
Base: 3458c6cb971f5d96fce8eda3abc3d708437ce713; verified HEAD before edits
origin/main: d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa; unchanged, no merge/rebase
T13B_A_CHECKPOINT: c31567ec7dfa8f95808c20c834b327cbb3425f9c
Publication: application/test checkpoint pushed without force, fetched, local/remote equality PASS
Documentation: separate descendant commit; continue from final published branch HEAD
Primary handoff: docs/ai/inventory-truth/t13/T13B_A_HANDOFF.md
Decision: docs/ai/inventory-truth/DECISIONS.md, DEC-016

Actual changes: per-line T09 CREATE for adopted receipt purchases preserves old lot
and new purchase truth; fridge grouped CORRECT unchanged. Validated `scanEvidence`
is in existing receipt/event fingerprints, not a new ledger/event-envelope key.
Production `correctionOf()` use; T10 rawName from retained OCR, null when absent,
with actual subject identity. Atomic confirmation retained. Committed concurrent
twins/response loss recover through scoped status-based replay and strict T11 reads.

Executed checks: `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`; focused Vitest **1,122/1,122
(17 suites)**; real local workerd/D1 **92/92 (5 suites)**; `pnpm typecheck`;
scoped ESLint (all six changed application/test files); `git diff --check`;
scope/ancestry/migration comparisons. All PASS. Exact commands in primary handoff.
Negative control: four new regression tests fail as expected at exact base; removed
the temporary worktree. Migration count 31; 0001–0031 untouched; 0032 absent.
Focused writer UNKNOWN = 0; canonical reader UNKNOWN = 0; no new stock SQL/readers.

Failures resolved: typed OCR/expiry mapping; incompatible top-level event metadata
(0025 guard, replaced by existing fingerprint extension); test helper binding and
storage-path assertions; intermittent D1 concurrent replay 500 (91/92 before fix,
92/92 after). No known failing Part A backend gate remains. Setup tool state issue
reported; direct locked dependency install worked without changing configuration.

NOT RUN — DEFERRED TO T13B-B FINAL VERIFICATION: full application suite/full lint/
build, dedicated migration smoke/schema/upgrade matrix, browser/mobile/UX checks,
adoption workflow, final T13 acceptance matrix/certification. No hosted CI requested.
Next action: verify repository/main guards and checkpoint ancestry, read the primary
handoff, complete Part B frontend/adoption scope and final verification. Do not
restart from main, rewrite prior T13, mutate migrations, merge or deploy.

## Current authoritative handoff — T13 Receipt/Vision Truth & Inventory UX V2, 2026-09-13

Program: Inventory Truth Layer — T08-T12 release train + T13 (final roadmap task)
Task: T13 RECEIPT/VISION TRUTH & INVENTORY UX V2 — implementation
Status: **T13 COMPLETE on branch; main NOT merged, nothing deployed**
Repository: vn-2i/frigo-dev (repository ID 1364064929 is ground truth; owner names redirect)
Branch: hoplite/lindos-0368e413
Base: exact 578f705f12cfde6e5ebe65bdc574154a0670c8df (ROADMAP_AUDIT_HEAD)

T13_APPLICATION_FREEZE: ad342703fb31a2b97d2798f1161fb83d4d0ed090
Primary documents: docs/ai/inventory-truth/t13/{README,RECEIPT_VISION_TRUTH,UX_V2,AUTHORITY_MAP,TEST_MATRIX,CONTINUATION}.md

Design: **evidence is not authority.** OCR/vision -> user review -> T10 observation ->
T09 command -> lots. T13 adds exactly ONE new write statement (a guarded INSERT into
inventory_observations riding the existing atomic batch) and ZERO new writers to
inventory_lots / inventory_items / inventory_events, and ZERO new inventory_items readers.
Writer and reader audits: UNKNOWN = 0.

Migration: 0031_scan_evidence_retention.sql, additive only. Adds ocr_raw_name, ocr_quantity,
ocr_unit, ocr_confidence (nullable: the legacy confidence column is NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.9 and
cannot represent "unknown") and review_state to scan_items, coupled to is_confirmed by
insert/update triggers rather than a column CHECK (ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... CHECK is
evaluated against pre-existing rows and would fail on already-confirmed rows). Migrations
0001-0030 untouched.

Executed checks (clean detached worktree /tmp/t13-freeze @ ad34270, pnpm install
--frozen-lockfile, status empty): full suite **3,177/3,177 across 124 files** (218.25 s);
real D1 **81/81** (5 files); lint PASS; typecheck PASS; build PASS; check:migrations PASS
(migration-smoke=ok); schema:check:local PASS (after `wrangler d1 migrations apply
frigo-db --local` provisions the gitignored local D1 in a fresh worktree — the gate reads
existing local state and does not create it); git diff --check PASS; git status --porcelain
empty. Baseline before T13: 3,092/120 and 70 real-D1.

Browser verification (isolated preview only; no remote D1, no deployment): flows A (receipt
-> review -> confirm -> RECEIPT provenance + real purchasedAt), C (MOVE), D (stale edit ->
409 CONFLICT with prior state preserved), D' (expiry UNKNOWN -> ESTIMATED -> UNKNOWN and
UNKNOWN -> KNOWN) and E (observation -> dismiss -> RECONCILED with stock untouched) all
verified. **7 defects that the green test suite had not caught were found this way** and are
fixed with permanent regression tests; the worst was a truncation-induced lot-id collision
that made every line of one receipt share a single lot id.

Failures: none outstanding.
Known verification limits: viewport emulation was unavailable in this sandbox (set viewport
and set device both left innerWidth at 1440), so the 360/390/430 check is a computed
layout-overflow probe (0 offenders) rather than a visual check; the reconciliation accept
(CORRECT/MOVE) path was exercised through tests and the API but not through a UI click,
because the seeded preview data yields STALE_OBSERVATION verdicts with no safe proposal
(which correctly disables the button). No hosted GitHub CI status exists for this SHA.

Next action: owner review of this branch. Do NOT merge main, deploy, run remote D1, touch
PayOS, rewrite migrations 0001-0030, add a second inventory writer, or enable
MEAL_PLANNER_ENABLED / cutover flags.

Platform overlay auto-commit c7e2296 corrected by 4553b8a (workspace file preserved byte-for-byte, uncommitted).
Canonical answer: adopted households read inventory_lots + validated authority
metadata via readInventoryAuthority/readInventoryLot/readInventorySummary;
inventory_items is checked-for-parity compatibility, never a fallback; reads
are single-batch coherent snapshots, bounded (1000), deterministic, tenancy-
fenced, fail-closed on corruption; observations/events never decide truth.
Cutover: fetchHouseholdInventoryFromDb (GET /inventory, recipes, scans list
reads, weekly planner, notifications) + adoption gate; legacy-only raw reads
documented INTENTIONAL_LEGACY_READ. API ids/version semantics preserved
additively (READ_CONSUMER_MAP.md §identity).
Verification: baseline 3,024/3,024 · 114 files on the base tree; freeze full

T09 ancestors intact (docs d522769…, application bf391c5…). Main d1b0673… NOT merged.
Root cause: the decision batch ended with `UPDATE inventory_observations … WHERE status='OPEN'
AND version=?`; a zero-row match is a silent D1 success (proven: success=true, changes=0), so the
batch never proved the claim. Losers were only stopped by the 0030 receipt trigger (raw SQLite
error leaked); without that trigger two DISMISS decisions both committed.
Fix: `observationClaimGuard` — last batch statement, INSERT INTO inventory_events with NULL
inventory_item_id WHERE changes() <> 1 → NOT NULL abort → D1 rolls back the entire batch (T09
commands, events, projection, decision receipt, observation). Loser classification:
committed same-key exact twin → replay; altered → IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT; observation not OPEN at
expected version → OBSERVATION_VERSION_CONFLICT; T09 CAS → STALE_SNAPSHOT/STALE_VERSION; else
PERSISTENCE_FAILED. Pre-batch exact replay still precedes OPEN/version rejection. No
process-local locks; the mechanism is D1's own atomic batch + changes().
Regressions: fence suite 13 (all fail pre-fix); real-D1 zero-row proof + controlled workerd race.
Verification: full 3,024/3,024 (114 files); T10 focused 98/98; T09 focused 323/323; real D1

checkout repeats everything with EMPTY status. No GitHub CI configured for the branch.
Preserved: multi-field composition (≤1 CORRECT + ≤1 MOVE, same lot/version, boundary
fail-closed, CORRECT+MOVE atomic via useCurrentLotVersion, unique #CORRECT/#MOVE keys,
explicit terminalState, fresh-plan authority, native/backfilled coherence).

statements (D1 expression depth <= 100); FEFO executor drops the fail-closed TS guard
(requireParity admission now governs, exactly as v1), authenticates replay mappings
via authoritativeMapping, and writes the lot CAS with the mapped projection identity.
Migration smoke now replays 0028 (previously missed) and 0029; the local D1 schema
gate requires 0029.
Verification: 13-test permanent backfilled-FEFO matrix (single/multi/mixed incl. kg
display, terminal/partial, replay, changed-intent, stale, lost response, tenancy,
drift, four race pairs plus a multi-lot allocation race); 1,237 focused/15 files;
2,926 full/108; 44 real local-D1; lint/typecheck/build/migration/schema/diff PASS;
clean detached exact-SHA checkout repeats everything with empty status. Native
equal-ID FEFO/PATCH suites unchanged and PASS. NO GITHUB CI STATUS.
Remaining P0/P1: NONE. Relevant merge-blocking P2: NONE known.
Next action: external final main-merge review. Do not merge main, deploy, touch
remote D1/PayOS, redesign guest transfer or start T10 from this packet.

Main anchor: d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa (branch 22 ahead / 0 behind)
Fresh Checks at the application freeze: 2,837 tests / 105 files PASS; 38 isolated

local D1 schema gate PASS (0028 required); clean-checkout gate recorded in
inventory-truth/t09/VERIFICATION.md.
What changed since the last handoff: atomic receipt-backed adoption with
empty-household evidence (0028); every inventory writer either serves adopted
households through the lot authority or fails closed; G concurrency/tenancy matrix;
final writer map without UNKNOWN. DEC-012 remains SAFE-DEFERRED.
Independent-review follow-up `27427383d61930ea1b67ccbc1d69bb1cc069f931` restores
committed adopted PATCH response-loss replay ahead of legacy version preflight,
rejects altered idempotency-key reuse, and keeps distinct-key CAS strict. Fresh full
verification: 2,838 tests / 105 files PASS (165.25s); lint/typecheck/build and
28-migration smoke PASS.
Next action: external independent review decides readiness. Do not merge to main,

Current Published Application SHA: aa43e069edbff7843e9eb7532ff386b27be96a17
Current Published Branch: hoplite/kos-2a686759
Current Scope: pure adoption preparation; mapped-authority legacy writer fences;
scan/shopping stock-revision fences; original scan retry identity; shopping
fingerprint/lease/committed-response recovery. DEC-012 unchanged.
Fresh Checks: 1,347 tests / 19 focused files; 2,808 / 103 full; 38 actual local-D1
tests; lint; typecheck; build; 27-migration replay; diff and protected paths PASS.
Scoped Review: two P2 findings corrected and independently re-reviewed; no remaining
P1/P2 within this partial increment, not a final T09 independent-review verdict.
Remaining: atomic adoption executor/activation marker and v3 evidence; functional
mapped-household adapters; original scan confirmation intent/result replay; full
G races/tenancy; H freeze/complete review. No new schema or active adoption yet.
Exact Next Action: implement additive, narrowly dispatched v3 ADOPT authority and
persist the pure plan in one fenced transaction, including empty-household marker;
extend writer admission before activation, then implement all functional adapters.
See F_ADOPTION_PLAN.md and VERIFICATION.md for exact constraints/failures.

## Recovery baseline and pre-transfer chronology

Transfer recovery: all canonical branches/tag fetched; required objects, full
consecutive ancestry and fsck PASS. Main unchanged at d1b0673; interrupted F was
18 ahead / 0 behind. Prior continuation is the read-only configured base;
unchanged-head publication rejected without mutation. One existing successor
starts exactly at 66858c5. Fresh baseline: 2,685 tests / 99 files and typecheck,
lint, 27-migration smoke, build PASS. Pre-existing settings overlay preserved in
stash `t09-transfer-preexisting-hoplite-settings-overlay`. Exact Next Action:
publish recovery docs, then explicit adoption/all-writer integration per
F_ADOPTION_PLAN.md; continue G/H only after real F acceptance. Previous repository
owners and the pre-transfer receipts below are historical provenance only.

Reason: Hoplite base branches are read-only; user authorized writable successor.
Ancestry and successor publication-first PASS at 8bf32ed4e41ed3341215c6376e0c13ef13043616.
E adds deterministic bounded FEFO USE, one atomic 1–32-effect batch, v2 receipt/event
authority and additive 0027; v1 predicates and 0023–0026 are unchanged. Existing
settings overlay remains outside this task. No adoption, live writer, HTTP or UI change.
Latest checks after the ordered-receipt fence: 1,172 focused / 11 files (35 actual
local D1 tests), full 2,659 / 98 files and lint/typecheck/build/migration smoke PASS.
Earlier post-replay-fix 1,170 focused / 2,657 full results predate that fence.
Isolated local D1 applied 27 migrations and schema gate returned success.
Failures fixed: D1 expression depth, SQL NULL fail-open, replay envelope/mode
misclassification; ordered-receipt follow-up and gate chronology are recorded in
`inventory-truth/t09/VERIFICATION.md`. Scoped E review has no remaining P1/P2
findings. E publication/fetch/equality/ancestry PASS. Exact Next Action: F explicit
adoption/all-writer integration per `inventory-truth/t09/F_ADOPTION_PLAN.md`;
DEC-012 guest-transfer safety is implemented with 143 focused auth/guest/outbox
tests PASS, full 2,685 / 99 and all static/build/local migration gates PASS.
No automatic guest-data fallback occurs. Adoption and other live
writers remain incomplete. Never push the frozen D base.
No main/legacy/production/staging/remote D1/PayOS/T10 changes.

## Historical handoff (not current task authority)

## Current branch handoff — published T08 completion (2026-09-10)

Fresh final-session verification: 130 focused tests; 1,617 full tests / 89 files;
lint, typecheck, build, 23-migration replay/local schema and diff checks PASS.
Prior sandbox-local D1 apply also passed 23/23. No remaining failure; publication
succeeded through the trusted broker and its exact head was fetched/confirmed.

Remaining T08 work: none. Exact next action: next account checks out
`origin/hoplite/xanthos-7d942897`, reads `inventory-truth/T08_VERIFICATION.md` and
the six handoff files, then waits for explicit T09 authorization.
Do not force-push, merge/rebase main, deploy or touch remote D1/PayOS.
Quantity that cannot fit exact milli-units fails preflight unchanged. Legacy data
is not live-synced; unknown/estimated evidence stays distinct and guest transfer
drift is diagnostic, not an auth rewrite. T09 owns commands/event authority/dual-write.

Cross-account takeover: first read the six `inventory-truth/` documents in order;
diff Last Verified SHA..HEAD. Exact executed commands, corrected failures, source
map and future integration risks are persisted there, not dependent on this chat.
Branch pushed: YES. Main/production/staging/remote D1/PayOS untouched: YES.

## Preserved release handoff (historical, separate production track)

## Active production integration handoff (2026-09-15)

WORKING_BRANCH: `integration/t13-takosan-qwen`

COMMON_BASE: `d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`

The current authorized task is a local/published integration candidate combining
production, the Qwen runtime branch, certified T13, and hardened Takosan. Source
IDs and SHAs are verified, production migration `0023_scan_request_fingerprint.sql`
is immutable, and the T13 migration bridge is planned at `0024`-`0033`.
`docs/integration/` is the current task packet. No candidate is designated yet.

Next action: checkpoint the analysis, integrate Qwen, merge T13/Takosan with
semantic conflict resolution, then run migration/static/full/browser gates.
Production main, remote D1, deployment, production R2/KV/queue, PayOS, and T14
remain untouched.

## Current status

T01-T07: COMPLETE

Release Integration: **COMPLETE**

Main Integration: **COMPLETE**

GitHub source of truth: main.

APPLICATION INTEGRATION: complete in main at `23ef51d6ec12a5a3e319a2d941dca39d2775cb9d`.

The main merge tree is source-equivalent to the verified release head. Changes
after the production application base on GitHub remain documentation-only; the
separate OCR recovery branch contains candidate code/config/test changes that
are not part of `main` or production.

## Production cutover receipt

**Status: COMPLETE - SCHEMA AND WORKER CUTOVER VERIFIED (2026-09-10).**
Migrations `0019` -> `0022` were applied in order after the retained D1 export,
then the Worker was deployed from a clean checkout of the approved `main` SHA.

### Live runtime

- Target: `https://frigo.tungjpstore.net` (Cloudflare Worker; no Frigo
  production process is running in this local checkout).
- Liveness and landing smoke returned HTTP 200.
- Readiness returned HTTP 200 with `status=degraded`, `environment=production`,
  and full `commit=d1b06732f8a80db4e77986df31ff28d9f04641fa`.
- Readiness services are database/queue/AI/email `ok` or `configured`, rate
  limiting is `kv-best-effort`, and the only issue is the non-blocking warning
  `CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING`; `config.ok=true` and no fatal issue were
  observed.
- Active Cloudflare version is `48e0c366-3c8a-4f2b-a2d5-965785995431` at 100%
  traffic (deployment started 2026-09-10T21:08:00Z).

### Source and schema comparison

- The deployed Worker reports the approved main SHA; no source-only divergence
  remains on the public runtime.
- Remote D1 ledger is exactly `0001` through `0022`; the exact schema gate passes,
  foreign-key violations are `0`, and 65 user tables are present.
- `pnpm week:reconcile:remote -- --strict --json` passes 2/2 plans, 0 orphan
  rows and 0 mismatches (14 Week days, 16 slots and 30 shopping rows observed).

### Backup and rehearsal

- Export: `.artifacts/frigo-db-pre-main-d1b0673-20260910T205627Z.sql`,
  mode 600, 521095 bytes, SHA-256
  `000c9cb88d6045afb19cca6ce3e1caa308b20ffa214dbb2cddfca0cb78d722eb`.
- Temporary-copy replay of `0019` -> `0022` passed foreign-key/integrity checks
  and all `0020` preflight guards before the remote apply.
- Key post-cutover counts remain users 28, households 28, inventory items 13,
  recipes 59, meal plans 2, scan queue jobs 15, sessions 2 and auth OTPs 0.
- Migrations are additive and order-dependent. There are no down-migrations;
  retain the additive schema and use only a schema-compatible code rollback.

### Operational finding and gate

- CORS probes now return the exact ACAO for the trusted origin and no ACAO for
  path-bearing, localhost or arbitrary origins.
- No planner flag, PayOS/payment path or production secret value was changed.

## Verification receipt

- Full: 1,487 tests / 87 files PASS.
- Focused T02-T07: 819 tests / 40 files PASS.
- D1 clean: 22 / 22 migrations PASS.
- Upgrade sanity: 0020 -> 0022 PASS.
- Existing rows preserved: 776 rows / 58 tables.
- Browser: 264 assertions / 36 phases PASS.
- Payment-adjacent: 82 tests / 7 files PASS.
- Final release CI: PASS.
- Post-cutover local gates: `pnpm lint`, `pnpm typecheck`,
  `pnpm check:migrations` and `pnpm build` PASS.
- Local `pnpm test`: 1,427/1,487 PASS; 60 failures are limited to the two shell
  UI suites because `localStorage`/`container` are unavailable in this runner.
- Hosted exact-SHA CI `34413458369`: 1,487 tests / 87 files PASS.
- Dependency audit: `pnpm audit --prod` reports 2 moderate `react-router`
  advisories (current v6 line; upstream fix requires v7.18.0). Treat the
  dependency upgrade as a separately tested follow-up; no emergency package
  change was made during this production cutover.
- `git diff --check`: PASS for the OCR candidate. `pnpm check` on 2026-09-13
  passed 1,579 tests / 93 files plus lint, typecheck, migration replay through
  `0023` and build. Hosted PR #17 CI run `34728606704` passed the same checks;
  live-provider smoke and production canary remain pending.

The local UI limitation is environmental; the hosted exact-SHA CI remains the
authoritative full-suite gate.

## OCR production-recovery candidate

The candidate is a code/config recovery with additive migration
`0023_scan_request_fingerprint.sql`; it does not amend the historical cutover
receipt or authorize a deployment.

- Qwen `qwen3.7-flash` is explicitly set as the primary provider for vision,
  receipt OCR, chat and ranking through the DashScope international endpoint
  (`QWEN_BASE_URL`, `QWEN_MODEL`); structured requests disable thinking. Groq is
  an opt-in legacy fallback through `GROQ_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true`, and is
  disabled in the candidate vars.
- Native Cloudflare vision is opt-in through `CLOUDFLARE_VISION_FALLBACK` and is
  `false` in the candidate worktree vars. DeepSeek remains the optional
  text/ranking fallback when `DEEPSEEK_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true`, and Z.ai/GLM the
  optional vision/text extension path when `GLM_FALLBACK_ENABLED=true`; GLM-5.3
  Flash is future model work, not an active claim.
- Zod plus a deterministic quality gate removes generic/placeholder labels and
  confidence below `0.6`; an empty usable result is the permanent
  `AI_SCAN_NO_USABLE_ITEMS` failure. OCR output remains reviewable draft data,
  not trusted inventory, price or safety authority.
- Typed provider failures distinguish permanent `MODEL_NOT_FOUND`, auth/permission,
  license, schema/invalid-response and quality errors from retryable
  `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`, `NETWORK_ERROR`, `RATE_LIMITED` and `UPSTREAM_ERROR` errors.
  Queue lease, idempotency, tenant fencing, attempt limits and DLQ semantics are
  unchanged.
- Scan status responses expose bounded failure codes and retry metadata without
  provider credentials or raw image content.
- The candidate adds additive migration `0023_scan_request_fingerprint.sql`.
  Local replay/schema checks cover `0001`-`0023`; production D1 now includes
  `0023` after the retained pre-0023 export. Worker deployment is verified.

Focused local checks and the full candidate gates passed on 2026-09-13:
`pnpm check` reports 1,579 tests / 93 files PASS, lint/typecheck/migration replay
through `0023` and build PASS; hosted PR #17 CI run `34728606704` is also green.
Live provider access is verified: a non-PII Qwen smoke returned HTTP 200 with
model `qwen3.7-flash` and `OK`; the key value is not stored in the repository or
logs. No separate staged canary was used; the guarded deploy went to 100% after
backup, migration and schema gate.

## Deployment and production boundary

Release packaging completed. Staging was not provisioned, so no staging deploy
occurred. The GitHub production environment/secrets are not provisioned, so the
approved release was deployed directly with Wrangler OAuth from a clean SHA
checkout; the same schema, smoke and readiness receipts were captured locally.

Production now reports candidate commit `bdb0dda0…`; readiness and liveness smoke
passed after deployment. Wrangler OAuth is authenticated as `tungbipdz@gmail.com`
for account `ef250a88911fd24073cb73d1c07e0218`.

PRODUCTION LOCAL RECONCILIATION COMPLETE - SCHEMA/CODE CUTOVER VERIFIED

Production local reconciliation: COMPLETE - post-cutover checks passed

PRODUCTION DATABASE MIGRATION COMPLETE - `frigo-db` at `0022`

Production DB migration: COMPLETE - exact ledger `0001` through `0022`

PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE - Worker version `48e0c366-3c8a-4f2b-a2d5-965785995431`

Production deployment: COMPLETE - readiness commit matches `d1b06732...`

Planner rollout: NOT STARTED. `PLUS_GRANT_SECRET` remains intentionally absent
and is reported as a warning; no secret values were read or changed.

## OCR image optimization candidate (2026-09-13)

`src/web/lib/private-image.ts` contains an uncommitted client-side optimization:
gallery images are decoded in memory, constrained to a 2,000 px longest side and
encoded as JPEG quality 0.82 only when smaller than the source. Small images are
not upscaled; originals are never mutated or stored; cancellation/session fencing
and a FileReader fallback are preserved. The attached receipt measured 2,116,353
bytes as PNG versus 382,334 bytes after a local quality-0.82 conversion (81.9%
reduction, same dimensions). Focused privacy/image tests pass 11/11. The
implementation is committed locally at `ba3d872eea2d677e38f94adb8355f493c4c45852`
but is not deployed; browser/device OCR recall and latency smoke is still
required before release.

PR #8 was not reopened, re-merged or modified during this task. Its verified
release tree is already contained in main. Application integration and PR
metadata are separate facts.

## Kirrha archival state

Kirrha is two commits ahead of current main and differs only in the four
`docs/ai/` release protocol documents. It has no application differences absent
from main. Do not merge or revert this historical branch.

## Protected areas

PayOS/payment code untouched.

No real payment performed.

## Next task

Next task: MONITOR OCR QUALITY/LATENCY AND SCHEDULE REACT ROUTER UPGRADE

Keep the deployed Worker and planner flags at safe defaults while the OCR
candidate is validated. Run focused provider/queue/UI tests and all required
local gates, then obtain authorized live-provider smoke, hosted CI, readiness and
canary evidence before any production deploy. Apply and verify additive migration
`0023_scan_request_fingerprint.sql` first; no production secret change is implied.
Do not touch PayOS/payment or use a down-migration. Rollback remains code-only to a schema-compatible SHA;
reserve D1 restore/export for an incident. Configure the GitHub `production`
environment, `PRODUCTION_URL` and Cloudflare secrets before the next guarded
release, and schedule the tested React Router major upgrade separately.

## Qwen runtime governance candidate (current task)

WORKING_BRANCH: `feat/qwen-ai-runtime-cost-router`

BASE_SHA: `05423f2ad675006a4c7913e696f1979b3fcaae59`

CANONICAL_MAIN_CHANGED: **NO**

PRODUCTION_DEPLOYED: **NO CHANGE / NOT AUTHORIZED**

The branch adds a fetch-compatible `QwenTaskRuntime` behind `AIRouter`. Tasks
resolve to logical roles (`QWEN_FAST`, `QWEN_FAST_CANARY`, `QWEN_MULTIMODAL`,
`QWEN_OCR`, `QWEN_REASONING`, `QWEN_JUDGE`) in one governance table. Physical
model IDs are supplied only by `AI_MODEL_*` configuration. Normal text uses the
pinned `qwen3.7-flash-2026-07-15`; OCR uses `qwen-vl-ocr`; multimodal work uses
`qwen3.8-flash`; reasoning and judge are disabled unless explicitly enabled.

The runtime enforces per-task input/output budgets, a per-operation call/token
ceiling, one repair plus one policy-approved escalation, Zod structured-output
validation, scan quality gates and cost metadata. `AIUsageLedger` aggregates
task/model calls, tokens, costs, failures, retries, escalation and latency;
Worker logs include only non-PII metadata. `AI_QWEN_ONLY=true` prevents legacy
Groq, DeepSeek, GLM and native Cloudflare providers from being constructed.

Inventory safety is unchanged: AI returns observation/candidate data only. The
existing normalization, validation, review, reconciliation, fencing and
idempotent inventory command remain the sole authority for mutations.

Final T08-T12 Inventory Truth end-to-end certification is still pending the
later unification with the separate `frigo-dev` lineage. This candidate does
not import that code or migrations; it only proves that Qwen runtime/provider
modules have no direct authoritative inventory mutation path.

Offline evaluation assets are `tests/fixtures/ai-golden.json`,
`tests/unit/ai-golden-dataset.test.ts` and `scripts/ai-eval.mjs`; run
`pnpm ai:eval -- --dry-run`. The command makes no live provider call and no CI
test requires an Alibaba credential.

Verification recorded for this checkpoint:

- Application checkpoint: `21c442d`.
- `pnpm check`: PASS — 1,606 tests / 95 files; lint, typecheck, migration replay
  and production build all PASS. Remote D1 schema and Week parity checks were
  skipped because no release flags were supplied.
- `pnpm ai:eval -- --dry-run`: PASS; fixture-only report, no Alibaba/Qwen call.
- `git diff --check`: PASS after the documentation edits.
- Focused command (`pnpm vitest run tests/unit/ai-runtime-governance.test.ts
  tests/unit/ai-router.test.ts tests/unit/qwen-provider.test.ts
  tests/unit/config-validation.test.ts tests/unit/meal-planning-explanation.test.ts
  tests/unit/scan-privacy.test.tsx tests/integration/scan-queue-retry-policy.test.ts
  tests/integration/scan-async-canary.test.ts`): **119 tests / 8 files PASS**;
  queue/idempotency regression coverage remains green.
- `pnpm audit --prod`: FAIL (2 moderate `react-router` advisories; patched
  upstream at `>=7.18.0`). This pre-existing dependency follow-up is outside
  the Qwen runtime scope; no package upgrade was made in this checkpoint.
- Secret scan, protected-path scan and provider/model search were clean. No
  PayOS/payment, unrelated auth, remote migration, merge or deployment action
  was performed.
- Local `main` is a separate divergent ref (`f6a48a1`); canonical source for
  this candidate is `github-frigo/main` at `05423f2`, and no local ref was
  changed.
- Final review found no concrete runtime defect requiring a code fix. Readiness
  already probes the additive scan columns from migration `0023`, and the
  deployment documentation correctly scopes the native `AI` binding to the
  explicit `CLOUDFLARE_VISION_FALLBACK=true` path.
- Publication checkpoint: `feat/qwen-ai-runtime-cost-router` is now published
  on `github-frigo` by a normal non-force push; `git ls-remote` verified the
  remote branch SHA matches the local candidate and canonical `main` remains
  `05423f2`. GitHub emitted only the repository-relocation notice to
  `Tungjpstore/Frigo`; no merge, deployment, remote migration or production
  change has occurred.

Next action after publication: request code review or a separately authorized
Qwen benchmark, then promote a pinned alias only through the documented
golden-dataset process. Do not merge, migrate remotely or deploy from this
branch.

## Qwen pre-unification hardening checkpoint (2026-09-13)

Implementation is complete on `feat/qwen-ai-runtime-cost-router` and remains
ahead of canonical `github-frigo/main` at `05423f2` without changing `main` or
production. The final changes are:

The verified application publication commit is
`f8468eaa7d7fed3cbcf5ac7e780eca07ad3d71e4`; the docs checkpoint containing
this handoff is intentionally a subsequent normal commit.
The final pre-documentation branch head, including the scheduler-failure
regression test, is `a145ef5`.

- `qwen-vl-ocr` capability metadata disables unsupported provider structured
  output and thinking controls while preserving prompt JSON, application parsing,
  normalization, Zod validation and scan quality gates. The rolling alias is
  explicitly `pinned=false`; no unverified snapshot was invented.
- Pricing defaults now reflect Singapore low-context planning values and carry
  `estimate-2026-09-sg-low-context` (judge remains a documented planning
  estimate). Usage remains estimated, not Alibaba invoice truth.
- `AI_MAX_IMAGE_BYTES` and `AI_MAX_OCR_IMAGE_BYTES` default to 5 MiB and are
  bounded to 64 KiB-20 MiB. Raw/data-URL base64 is checked by decoded-byte
  estimate before any Qwen provider call; remote URLs remain upstream-limited.
- Shadow canary is lifecycle-safe: `backgroundExecutor` schedules the reserved
  promise through Worker `executionCtx.waitUntil`; hosts without an executor
  skip shadow. The default canary percentage remains zero, and scheduler
  invocation failures are isolated from successful primary responses.

Verification completed 2026-09-13:

- Focused command: **134 tests / 8 files PASS**.
- `pnpm check`: **1,623 tests / 95 files PASS**; lint, typecheck, migration
  replay and production build PASS.
- `pnpm ai:eval -- --dry-run`: PASS, six fixture cases, no live request.
- `git diff --check`: PASS.
- `pnpm audit --prod`: FAIL with two known moderate React Router advisories;
  patched upstream at `>=7.18.0`, upgrade intentionally deferred.

No live Qwen benchmark, production deploy, remote migration, secret change,
merge, PayOS/payment modification or T08-T12 Inventory Truth import occurred.
Queue/HTTP compatibility and inventory mutation boundaries remain intact. The
next action is to verify the final normal push SHA with `git ls-remote`, obtain
code review, and only then consider a separately authorized benchmark/release.
Do NOT git pull/reset directly inside running production. Production-local source
must first be snapshotted and compared against the final post-merge GitHub main
head, with
application lineage anchored at `PRODUCTION_APPLICATION_BASE_SHA`. Do not deploy,
run remote migrations, enable planner flags or alter production configuration as
part of this bookkeeping task. Do not treat `PRE_CLEANUP_MAIN_HEAD` as the final
head.

## SAFE STOP — T13R-B — 2026-09-13T21:35Z

T13R-B truth-presentation remediation checkpointed at WIP `7e68e3b` on
`hoplite/medma-164548ce` (P2-1 already committed as `4d587eb`). Full
status, test evidence, and next step: `docs/ai/inventory-truth/t13/T13R_B_REMEDIATION.md`.
Findings P2-1/P2-4/P2-5/P2-6 = FIXED (test-backed, NOT certified). No
freeze created. Main unchanged. See T13R_B_REMEDIATION.md before continuing.
## Canonical promotion CLI handoff (2026-09-15)

**HISTORICAL CHECKPOINT — SUPERSEDED BY THE MERGED PR #2 RECEIPT ABOVE.**

The canonical promotion remains intentionally unmerged. GitHub CLI verified
`vn-dlo/Frigo-dev`, PR #1, base `main`, and promotion head
`ae1689c1f5525262da3478137b402692e4e4ed45`. The head differs from the prior
receipt only by an empty commit used to request a fresh PR event; application,
migration, and documentation trees are unchanged by that commit.

The exact hosted CI gate is unresolved: `gh run list` and PR checks are empty,
and `gh workflow run` returns HTTP 422 `Actions has been disabled for this
user`. The CLI account is `Tungjpstore` with push but not admin/maintain access;
branch protection is not configured/visible. Do not merge or deploy. An admin
must enable Actions and confirm main protection, then rerun checks against the
exact head and explicitly authorize a history-preserving merge.

Follow-up: `gh` is now authenticated as repository owner `vn-dlo` with admin/
maintain access. Main protection is configured to require one PR approval and
the `validate` status, with force-push and deletion disabled. The promotion
head is `6ec7ff08ef258ef2ca95fb5d24b581b939ef1c92`; this is another empty
tree-neutral trigger commit. Actions is enabled, but no exact-head workflow run
has appeared. Do not merge until the `validate` check is actually present and
passing, then obtain explicit maintainer authorization.

Owner-visible PR #2 (`canonical/5f6853d-promotion-ci`) now has exact hosted CI
run `34968012294` passing on `8eb6d2b8d54e5e2fd08c0a11acd9f57a1e068b24`.
Hosted validate completed lint, typecheck, full Vitest, migration smoke, and
build successfully. Main protection correctly leaves the PR blocked pending
one independent approval; no merge or deployment has occurred.

## Current auth handoff (2026-09-16)

Safari showed a blank Google OAuth popup at `accounts.google.com/gsi/transform`.
The live `/auth` headers included `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin`.
Hono `secureHeaders` was the effective source because it ran after the custom
header middleware and overwrote the GIS-compatible value. The fix disables
that one Hono default and sets COOP by path: SPA `same-origin-allow-popups`, API
`same-origin`. The regression test is green (`17/17` focused tests), with lint,
typecheck and diff check green. PR #9 merged as `911db7f`; Worker version
`20bc1f35-6ffe-4085-ba79-d54a0b53da71` is live at 100%. Production smoke and
readiness pass, `/auth` now returns `same-origin-allow-popups`, and `/api/*`
retains `same-origin`. The only readiness warning is the pre-existing
`CONFIG_PLUS_GRANT_SECRET_MISSING`; no migration or production data resource
was changed.
## T18C resumed — source comparison checkpoint (2026-09-21)

- **Status:** T18C_PARTIAL; historical pause below is retained, not current.
- **Resume:** `2e770f8e93bdda63dc3534093dc313d99fab229d`, existing branch,
  main `b8447e85`, repository `1368281478` / `vn-tako/Frigo-dev`.
  Correct upstream is `origin/feat/t18c-final-redesign-certification`.
- **Executed:** `PORT=5173 pnpm exec playwright test -c
  playwright.t18c.config.ts tests/e2e/t17-ui/t18c-matrix.e2e.ts` — 6 passed,
  162 captures/audits, zero axe violations/overflow. Source remains unedited
  since the pause. Style 39 allowlisted/0 unjustified; contrast 33/33
  configured pairs (one decorative informational pair).
- **Evidence:** baseline untouched; `fixed-tree.zip` preserves the fresh
  rerun. `approved-source.zip` now preserves the supplied original kit.
  See `T18C_SOURCE_PROVENANCE.md` for hashes and authority hierarchy.
- **Environment:** dependency install was missing. Durable project setup/run
  overrides use frozen pnpm install, Chromium, SQLite and repository-owned
  isolated Preview on 5173. Platform setup claim failed twice; the exact
  setup command succeeded through shell. Settings file remains untouched.
- **Next:** finish direct 27-screen comparison, classify/fix evidenced UI
  gaps, run T17 and final gates, then produce separate final evidence.
  Do not reuse pause-tree results for subsequent edits. No human screen-reader
  test, merge, deploy, remote migration or T18D.

# T20 hardening handoff — 2026-09-26 UTC

## State and checkpoints

Not production-ready: `main` is PR #7 merge `bf57451` (`bf57451e4a1a047eeff7a0938b903d1a37b6f8c9`), last
main CI `36221190222` FAIL in the T20 add/remove race test. PR #8 remains
OPEN, head `5b0a6b9` (`5b0a6b995786b338999286023eb2e46de4bc45a7`), MERGEABLE/CLEAN, no unresolved review

that exact head passed (201 files / 4,554 tests, migrations, build). Agent
merge is disallowed; no C1 exact-main green SHA or merge SHA yet.

Follow-up branch `fix/t20-postmerge-ci-picker-cuisine--hardening`, PR #9 base
PR #8: C2 `762015f` (torn-read 409 semantics); C3 `bc92346` (picker stale-page

No known outstanding in-scope P0/P1/P2; no T19 authority or 500-catalog change.

## Executed checks

- C2: `pnpm exec vitest run tests/integration/t20-meal-composition-stale-read.test.ts tests/integration/t20-meal-composition-flows.test.ts` — 22/22 PASS; `pnpm typecheck`, `pnpm lint`, `git diff --check` PASS. Initial fixture used an invalid slot ID and failed one assertion; corrected to a valid absent ID, then reran green. No sleeps/retries.

Picker Vietnamese/Korean/Japanese, role+cuisine+search, filtered empty/clear, load more 20→40 unique, focus trap, Escape restores opener, no horizontal overflow or browser errors. Screenshots inspected locally. This is NOT staging smoke.

## Release blockers and next action

PR #9 has no hosted CI while based on PR #8's branch; `ci.yml` only triggers PRs
targeting main/master. Merge PR #8 via normal PR flow, wait for its exact-main
CI, retarget PR #9 to main, verify exact-head hosted CI, zero unresolved review
threads and mergeability, then merge PR #9 normally and verify exact-main CI.
No direct push/force push to main. Staging config exists, but Cloudflare
credentials are absent here and GitHub environment secrets are unreadable
(403), so the target identity, pre-ledger, bookmark and aggregate baseline
cannot be checked. 0039 ledger before/after unknown; staging migration/deploy/
flag-on smoke NOT performed. After authorized staging access, follow
`DEPLOYMENT.md`: verify staging target and ledger, use reviewed migration
mechanism, inspect FK/quick check and 500 catalog, deploy certified main with
both flags OFF first, then explicitly opt in and run Manual/Assisted/Auto,
safety, shopping, legacy, T19 and UX smokes. Production authorization was not
given: `production_migration=NO`, `production_deploy=NO`,
`production_enablement=NO`.

# T21R-B offline semantic snapshot handoff — 2026-10-01

**State:** `T21RB_OFFLINE_TOOLING_READY`; no production row snapshot has been
captured. Implementation commit `5dd9990` on
`codex/t21rb-offline-semantic-snapshot` follows the separate T21R-A target
commit `6bcef891`. See
`recipe-catalog/T21RB_OFFLINE_SEMANTIC_SNAPSHOT_DESIGN.md` for target, capture
boundary, classification rules and unresolved consistency caveat.

**Executed:** `pnpm exec vitest run tests/unit/t21rb-v1-semantic.test.mjs`
8/8 PASS; comparator plus staging Wrangler focused rerun 40/40 PASS; local
SQLite 0038 replay through the offline CLI matched 2,702/2,702 ingredient
tuples in 500 recipes. `WRANGLER_SEND_METRICS=false pnpm check` passed types
and lint, then one staging Wrangler startup test timed out at 5 seconds while
4,897/4,898 tests passed. Controlled full Vitest rerun with `--maxWorkers=2`
passed 224 files / 4,898 tests. Migration smoke and build passed separately;
`node --check` and `git diff --check` passed. The combined check failed and
is not reported as green.

**Limits:** The tool accepts a saved five-statement local JSON input and emits
sanitized aggregate counts. The prior production artifacts contain no raw
rows. Separate D1 SELECTs and a stable migration ledger do not prove an atomic
production snapshot. The tool is not wired to a remote workflow; no production
read, mutation, repair, 0039, deploy or flag change occurred. T21G remains
`T21G_NOT_READY`.

**Next:** Independently review the offline tool and a protected runner-local
capture/consistency design, then use exact-main CI and production Environment
approval for a new read-only capture if authorized. Keep raw rows runner-local
and review only a sanitized V1-relative receipt. Do not infer repair actions
from classification counts.

# T21R-B protected V1 diagnostic integration handoff — 2026-10-02 JST

**State:** `T21RB_PROTECTED_INTEGRATION_PREPARED`; no production V1 snapshot
has been captured. Repository ID `1385308553` resolves to
`vn-tako4/Tako-san`; verified GitHub main and local `origin/main` are
`3e0f6531b98feb1e44743513b91aff131bbd522b`. Branch
`codex/t21rb-offline-semantic-snapshot` starts this continuation at
`8d275b5e30bc6b29a40d7747f18512a82e436a73`. Implementation checkpoint:
`90569fa6e9890403bbbf57eaecad2c6e049fd1e8`.

**Implemented:** `.github/workflows/production-d1-diagnostics.yml` performs a
second guarded five-statement catalog read and third migration-ledger read.
`scripts/t21rb-v1-production.mjs` requires complete equal captures, reviewed
0038 ledger prefix, matching order coverage and prior diagnostic, repository
and D1 identity, and the certified V1 manifest hash. It calls the offline
comparator without Cloudflare credentials and emits an allowlisted aggregate
receipt only after the workflow's final exact-main check. Raw rows and raw-row
digests are not uploaded. `scripts/t21rb-v1-semantic.mjs` rejects boolean or
whitespace-only raw ingredient fields. Tests cover drift, contradictory flags,
coverage, identity, malformed fields and output redaction. The design packet
specifies the ingredient-only and non-atomic evidence boundary.

**Executed:** `pnpm exec vitest run tests/unit/t21rb-v1-production.test.mjs
 tests/unit/t21rb-v1-semantic.test.mjs
 tests/unit/production-d1-diagnostics.test.mjs` — 3 files / 23 tests PASS.
`pnpm lint` and `pnpm typecheck` PASS. `pnpm check:migrations` PASS
(`migration-smoke=ok`); `pnpm build` PASS. `node --check` on both changed
scripts and `git diff --check` PASS. `pnpm exec vitest run --maxWorkers=2`
passed 225 files / 4,906 tests twice, including once after the implementation
commit on the frozen tree. Earlier in this continuation, an initial diagnostic
fixture mismatch caused two focused test failures; correcting the `{name,id}`
shape yielded the final 23/23. `node --test` failed because the files require
Vitest; the correct runner passed. No combined `pnpm check` result is claimed.

**Limits:** `OBSERVED_STABLE_NON_ATOMIC` means two equal observations across
separate SELECTs, not a transactionally pinned state. The receipt classifies
only the recipe ID set and V1 ingredient tuples. It does not certify recipe
order, metadata, steps, nutrition, physical line identity, live positions or
T20 hard-restriction evidence. `NOT_A_RELEASE_CERTIFICATION`,
`runtimePositionAuthority=false`, `repairAuthorized=false` and
`T21G_NOT_READY` remain explicit. Production read dispatches, SQL mutations,
restore calls, migration/0039 applies, flag changes and deploys: **0**.

**Next:** independent review of this branch, protected merge and exact-main CI,
then separately authorize a manual read-only production Environment dispatch.
Inspect the sanitized V1 receipt and plan a distinct protected row-evidence
path for unresolved occurrences before any T21G repair design. Do not infer a
repair action from counts; 0039 and production deploy remain stopped.

---

# T21R-B protected integration merge handoff — 2026-10-02 JST

**State:** `T21RB_PROTECTED_INTEGRATION_MERGED`. PR #33 merged reviewed head
`0b28b48e2fbd8f4892ddbf57ae9139d96addc0a3` into main as
`483e054b8ad5e0391aaedfcaf65343ce95949562`. PR exact-head run
`36931130799` and merge exact-main run `36931887016` both passed `validate`.
The independent read-only review found no concrete issue. See
`recipe-catalog/T21RB_PROTECTED_INTEGRATION_MERGE_RECEIPT.md` for the exact
checks and remaining evidence limits.

**Production boundary:** No D1 read dispatch, mutation, restore, 0039 apply,
flag change or deploy. The workflow is manual and retains the exact-main CI,
production Environment, account/D1 identity and ledger guards. Two matching
five-statement observations are `OBSERVED_STABLE_NON_ATOMIC`, not a release
certification. Only recipe ID set and V1 ingredient tuples are compared.
`T21G_NOT_READY`; `repairAuthorized=false`.

**Next:** operator separately authorizes a manual read-only diagnostic at an
exact current-main SHA. Review the sanitized V1 receipt and unresolved rows
before a distinct protected row-evidence path. Do not infer repair from counts;
0039 and production deploy stay stopped.
